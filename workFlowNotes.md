# Workflow Notes

Current workflow includes compiling through Overleaf LaTeX service. The real benefit of this is collaboration, a secondary benefit is reliability for compilation despite working on the project on different computers. 

Options for writing include:

1. Directly in a web browswer on Overleaf.com
2. In GitHub where changes can be committed and then pulled into Overleaf (manually)
3. In any text editor or IDE that is locally stored but either pushes / pulls from GitHub OR is in the Dropbox Overleaf project folder
