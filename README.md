# Clinical Physiology
## A muscle centered approach

A manuscript in progress for a book (Open Educational Resource, OER) for use in the clinical physiology in the DPT program at Plymouth State University.

To enter comments into chapter text start a new line and begin the line with a percent sign %

% This is a comment that will not appear in the chapter when compiled

Note:
Some of the chapters ended up taking on different names after I had named the files for the chapters (which is referred to in the index.tex file that tells LaTeX which files to put together (and in what order) for the book. I'll eventually change the file names and the index file to represent the new names.

## Getting ready for the second draft (2023)

- Need a section in the Preface on "How to Read This Book"
- Need a first draft for the Digestion, Absorption, Metabolism chapter (Sean - but need to check with Kelly)
- Need a first draft for the integrity section (several chapters) (Kyle and Sean)
- Need a first draft for the Integrative exercises section
  - Fick's Equation (Nathaniel)
  - Calcium Regulation (Sean)
  - Exercise Prescription (Kyle)
- Consider dividing Blood Flow chapter into two - last year students got much more from the two "Pulmonary" chapters - divided into Ventilation and Respiration than they did from the one "Blood Flow" chapter. Need to decide the best way to divide that chapter to have it fit
- The pulmonary chapters (Ventilation and Respiration) need graphics to replace my drawings
- All second draft chapters need improved objectives
- All second draft chapters need proof reading and to be improved in terms of succinct, clear, language (write tight)
- All chapters need "Problems", "Exercises", "Thought" and/or "Reflection" questions throughout the chapter - should follow a section. Should also consider
- Consider adding an index and a glossary

## References

- Held on Zotero at this link: https://www.zotero.org/groups/4709608/clinical_phys_muscle
- Need to organize the Zotero files by chapter
- Need to do a deeper dive into topics to make them more relevant to PT.... more to come on this concept

## Graphics

- Need graphics for ventilation and respiration chapter
- Considering moving DAGitty based directed graph (bioenergetics) to either SimGen or Cytoscape
- Expand on directed graphics (most likely SimGen)
- Expansion of graphics should be paired with reduction of text, improved explanatory text of the graphic, and exercises for the reader to use the graphic for reasoning

## Longer term steps to the project

- Generate original graphics of simulation results using either Hummod or JSim models (or other Physiome based models)
