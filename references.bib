	abstract = {Preconditioning refers to a procedure by which a single noxious stimulus below the threshold of damage is applied to the tissue in order to increase resistance to the same or even different noxious stimuli given above the threshold of damage. Hypoxic preconditioning relies on complex and active defenses that organisms have developed to counter the adverse consequences of oxygen deprivation. The protection it confers against ischemic attack for instance as well as the underlying biological mechanisms have been extensively investigated in animal models. Based on these data, hypoxic conditioning (consisting in recurrent exposure to hypoxia) has been suggested a potential non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention to enhance some physiological functions in individuals in whom acute or chronic pathological events are anticipated or existing. In addition to healthy subjects, some benefits have been reported in patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as in overweight and obese individuals. Hypoxic conditioning consisting in sessions of intermittent exposure to moderate hypoxia repeated over several weeks may induce hematological, vascular, metabolic, and neurological effects. This review addresses the existing evidence regarding the use of hypoxic conditioning as a potential therapeutic modality, and emphasizes on many remaining issues to clarify and future researches to be performed in the field.},

	abstract = {Intermittent hypoxia ({IH}) has been the subject of considerable research in recent years, and triggers a bewildering array of both detrimental and beneficial effects in multiple physiological systems. Here, we review the extensive literature concerning {IH} and its impact on the respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, metabolic, bone, and nervous systems. One major goal is to define relevant {IH} characteristics leading to safe, protective, and/or therapeutic effects vs. pathogenesis. To understand the impact of {IH}, it is essential to define critical characteristics of the {IH} protocol under investigation, including potentially the severity of hypoxia within episodes, the duration of hypoxic episodes, the number of hypoxic episodes per day, the pattern of presentation across time (e.g., within vs. consecutive vs. alternating days), and the cumulative time of exposure. Not surprisingly, severe/chronic {IH} protocols tend to be pathogenic, whereas any beneficial effects are more likely to arise from modest/acute {IH} exposures. Features of the {IH} protocol most highly associated with beneficial vs. pathogenic outcomes include the level of hypoxemia within episodes and the number of episodes per day. Modest hypoxia (9–16\% inspired O
              2
              ) and low cycle numbers (3–15 episodes per day) most often lead to beneficial effects without pathology, whereas severe hypoxia (2–8\% inspired O
              2
              ) and more episodes per day (48–2,400 episodes/day) elicit progressively greater pathology. Accumulating evidence suggests that “low dose” {IH} (modest hypoxia, few episodes) may be a simple, safe, and effective treatment with considerable therapeutic potential for multiple clinical disorders.},

	abstract = {The mechanical advantages of the external and internal intercostals depend partly on the orientation of the muscle but mostly on interspace number and the position of the muscle within each interspace. Thus the external intercostals in the dorsal portion of the rostral interspaces have a large inspiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases ventrally and caudally such that in the ventral portion of the caudal interspaces, it is reversed into an expiratory mechanical advantage. The internal interosseous intercostals in the caudal interspaces also have a large expiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases cranially and, for the upper interspaces, ventrally as well. The intercartilaginous portion of the internal intercostals (the so-called parasternal intercostals), therefore, has an inspiratory mechanical advantage, whereas the triangularis sterni has a large expiratory mechanical advantage. These rostrocaudal gradients result from the nonuniform coupling between rib displacement and lung expansion, and the dorsoventral gradients result from the three-dimensional configuration of the rib cage. Such topographic differences in mechanical advantage imply that the functions of the muscles during breathing are largely determined by the topographic distributions of neural drive. The distributions of inspiratory and expiratory activity among the muscles are strikingly similar to the distributions of inspiratory and expiratory mechanical advantages, respectively. As a result, the external intercostals and the parasternal intercostals have an inspiratory function during breathing, whereas the internal interosseous intercostals and the triangularis sterni have an expiratory function.},

Similarly, complementary therapy such as alternate nostril breathing exercise has a direct effect on mental and physical health. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: This is a quantitative experimental research with randomized controlled trial design. A total of 170 and 85 individuals were allotted to each group. Patients in the study group were instructed alternate nostril breathing exercise two times a day (10 min duration of exercise each time) for 5 days along with routine treatment, and patients in the control group underwent routine treatment.
{RESULTS}: There was a marked reduction in systolic blood pressure ({BP}), diastolic {BP}, heart rate, and rate pressure product after the continuous 5‑day alternate nostril breathing exercise in the study group. P {\textless} 0.0001 demonstrated a statistically significant difference in systolic {BP}, diastolic {BP}, heart rate, and rate pressure product that existed pre‑ and post‑assessment on 1st day and 5th day.
{CONCLUSION}: It can be concluded that regular simple alternate nostril breathing exercise effectively reduces hypertension.},

Assessments included heart rate variability, skin conductance, ﬁnger plethysmogram amplitude, breath rate, and blood pressure. Following {RNYB} there was a signiﬁcant increase in systolic, diastolic and mean pressure.

	abstract = {Objectives: To measure the effect of the right and left nostril yoga breathing on frontal hemodynamic responses in 32 right handed healthy male subjects within the age range of 18–35 years (23.75 ± 4.14 years). Materials and Methods: Each subject practiced right nostril yoga breathing ({RNYB}), left nostril yoga breathing ({LNYB}) or breath awareness ({BA}) (as control) for 10 min at the same time of the day for three consecutive days, respectively. The sequence of intervention was assigned randomly. The frontal hemodynamic response in terms of changes in the oxygenated hemoglobin ({oxyHb}), deoxygenated hemoglobin ({deoxyHb}), and total hemoglobin ({totalHb} or blood volume) concentration was tapped for 5 min before (pre) and 10 min during the breathing practices using a 16 channel functional near‑infrared system ({FNIR}100‑{ACK}‑W, {BIOPAC} Systems, Inc., U.S.A.). Average of the eight channels on each side (right and left frontals) was obtained for the two sessions (pre and during). Data was analyzed using {SPSS} version 10.0 through paired and independent samples t‑test.
Results: Within group comparison showed that during {RNYB}, {oxyHb} levels increased significantly in the left prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) as compared to the baseline (P = 0.026). {LNYB} showed a trend towards significance for reduction in {oxyHb} in the right hemisphere (P = 0.057). Whereas {BA} caused significant reduction in {deoxyHb} (P = 0.023) in the left hemisphere. Between groups comparison revealed that {oxyHb} and blood volume in the left {PFC} increased significantly during {RNYB} as compared to {BA} ({oxyHb}: P =0.012; {TotalHb}: P =0.017) and {LNYB} ({oxyHb}: P =0.024; {totalHb}: P =0.034).
Conclusion: {RNYB} increased oxygenation and blood volume in the left {PFC} as compared to {BA} and {LNYB}. This supports the relationship between nasal cycle and ultradian rhythm of cerebral dominance and suggests a possible application of uninostril yoga breathing in the management of psychopathological states which show lateralized cerebral dysfunctions.},

In {RNB} and {LNB} groups, prediction of rate-pressure product ({RPP}) by low-frequency to high-frequency ratio ({LF}-{HF}) of {HRV} was assessed by bivariate logistic regression. Results: {HRV} indices representing sympathetic activity were increased in the {RNB} group and indices representing parasympathetic activity were increased in {LNB} group following 6-week nostril breathing. Prediction of {LF}-{HF} to {RPP}, the marker of cardiovascular risks, was more signiﬁcant ({OR} 2.65, P = 0.005) in the {LNB} group compared to the {RNB} group ({OR} 1.452, P = 0.016).

While bad habits can interfere with the position of the teeth and normal pattern of skeletal growth, on the other hand obstruction of the upper airway, resulting in mouth breathing, changes the pattern of craniofacial growth causing malocclusion. Our crosssectional study, carried out on 3017 children using the {ROMA} index, was developed to verify if there was a significant correlation between bad habits/mouth breathing and malocclusion. The results showed that an increase in the degree of the index increases the prevalence of bad habits and mouth breathing, meaning that these factors are associated with more severe malocclusions. Moreover, we found a significant association of bad habits with increased overjet and openbite, while no association was found with crossbite. Additionally, we found that mouth breathing is closely related to increased overjet, reduced overjet, anterior or posterior crossbite, openbite and displacement of contact points. Therefore, it is necessary to intervene early on these aetiological factors of malocclusion to prevent its development or worsening and, if already developed, correct it by early orthodontic treatment to promote eugnatic skeletal growth.},

	abstract = {The discovery within the paranasal sinuses for the production of nitric oxide ({NO}) has altered the traditional explanations of sinus physiology. This review article reports the ongoing investigation of sinus physiology beginning with the discovery of {NO} gas production in the paranasal sinuses that occurred in 1995, and the impact that ﬁnding has had both in the basic science and clinical arenas. It was shown that healthy paranasal sinus epithelium expresses an inducible {NO} synthase that continuously generates large amounts of {NO}, a pluripotent gaseous messenger with potent vasodilating, and antimicrobial activity. This {NO} can be measured noninvasively in nasally exhaled breath. The role of {NO} in the sinuses is likely to enhance local host defense mechanisms via direct inhibition of pathogen growth and stimulation of mucociliary activity. The {NO} concentration in a healthy sinus exceeds those that are needed for antibacterial effects in vitro. In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia ({PCD}) and in cystic ﬁbrosis, nasal {NO} is extremely low. This defect {NO} generation likely contributes to the great susceptibility to chronic sinusitis in these patients. In addition, the low-nasal {NO} is of diagnostic value especially in {PCD}, where nasal {NO} is very low or absent. Intriguingly, {NO} gas from the nose and sinuses is inhaled with every breath and reaches the lungs in a more diluted form to enhance pulmonary oxygen uptake via local vasodilation. In this sense {NO} may be regarded as an ‘‘aerocrine’’ hormone that is produced in the nose and sinuses and transported to a distal site of action with every inhalation.

R-R intervals, end tidal {CO}2, ﬁnger arterial pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity ({MSNA}) were measured simultaneously in 7 subjects during saline, atropine and propranolol infusion. The measurements were repeated during spontaneous and ﬁxed-frequency breathing, and apnea. The power spectra, phase coherence and couplings were calculated to characterise the variability and interactions within the cardiovascular system. Atropine reduced R-R interval variability (p {\textless} 0.05) in all three breathing conditions, reduced {MSNA} power during apnea and removed much of the signiﬁcant coherence and couplings. Propranolol had smaller effect on the power of oscillations and did not change the number of signiﬁcant interactions. Most notably, atropine reduced R-R interval power in the 0.145–0.6 Hz interval during apnea, which supports the hypothesis that the {RSA} is modulated by a mechanism other than the baroreﬂex. Atropine also reduced or made negative the phase shift between the systolic and diastolic pressure, indicating the cessation of baroreﬂex-dependent blood pressure variability. This result suggests that coherent respiratory oscillations in the blood pressure can be used for the non-invasive assessment of autonomic regulation.},

	abstract = {Summary The heart and those striated muscles that contract for long periods, having available almost limitless oxygen, operate in sustained steady states of low sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure that resist change in response to changing muscle work or oxygen supply. Most of the oxygen pressure drop from the erythrocyte to the mitochondrion occurs across the capillary wall. Within the sarcoplasm, myoglobin, a mobile carrier of oxygen, is developed in response to mitochondrial demand and augments the ﬂow of oxygen to the mitochondria. Myoglobin-facilitated oxygen diffusion, perhaps by virtue of reduction of dimensionality of diffusion from three dimensions towards two dimensions in the narrow spaces available between mitochondria, is rapid relative to other parameters of cell respiration. Consequently, intracellular gradients of oxygen pressure are shallow, and sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure is nearly the same everywhere. Sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure, buffered near 0.33·{kPa} (2.5·torr; equivalent to approximately 4·µmol·l–1 oxygen) by equilibrium with myoglobin, falls close to the operational Km of cytochrome oxidase for oxygen, and any small increment in sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure will be countered by increased oxygen utilization. The concentration of nitric oxide within the myocyte results from a balance of endogenous synthesis and removal by oxymyoglobin-catalyzed dioxygenation to the innocuous nitrate. Oxymyoglobin, by controlling sarcoplasmic nitric oxide concentration, helps assure the steady state in which inﬂow of oxygen into the myocyte equals the rate of oxygen consumption.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Konstantin Buteyko, M.D., Ph.D., claimed that breath holding time ({BHT}) can be used to detect chronic hyperventilation and that {BHT} predicts alveolar {CO}2 ({PaCO}2) according to his patented mathematical formula. The Buteyko Breathing Technique ({BBT}) is believed to correct chronic hyperventilation as evidenced by increased {BHT}. In this study, we test Buteyko’s claims and explore the relationship between {BHT} and end-tidal carbon dioxide ({ETCO}2) as well as measures of dysfunctional breathing ({DB}) including the Nijmegen questionnaire, the Self Evaluation of Breathing Questionnaire, and thoracic dominant breathing pattern. Subjects: Eighty-three (83) adults healthy or suspected of having dysfunctional breathing, 29 with abnormal spirometry readings, 54 with normal spirometry. Outcome measures: {BHT}, performed according to {BBT} protocols, was measured along with {ETCO}2 and other measures of {DB} including the Nijmegen questionnaire, and manual assessment of respiratory motion, a palpatory technique for measuring thoraco-abdominal balance during breathing. Correlations between measures of {DB} were made in the whole sample and also in subgroups with normal or abnormal spirometry. {DB} measures were compared in normal and abnormal spirometry groups.
Results: The results revealed a negative correlation between {BHT} and {ETCO}2 (r ϭ Ϫ0.241, p Ͻ 0.05), directly opposite to Buteyko’s claims. {BHT} was significantly shorter in people with abnormal spirometry ({FEV}1 or {FVC} Ͻ 15\% below predicted), with no difference in {ETCO}2 levels between the abnormal and normal spirometry groups. In the abnormal spirometry group, lower {BHT} was found to correlate with a thoracic dominant breathing pattern. (r ϭ Ϫ0.408, p Ͻ 0.028).
Conclusions: Although {BHT} does not predict resting {ETCO}2, it does correlate with breathing pattern in subjects with abnormal spirometry. It is proposed that altered breathing pattern could contribute to breathing symptoms such as dyspnea and that breathing therapies such as {BBT} might influence symptoms by improving the efficiency of the biomechanics of breathing.},

	abstract = {A hypothesis is presented that explains the physiological reasons why the magnitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia ({RSA}) appears to correlate with cardiac vagal tone. The hypothesis is that {RSA} is an intrinsic resting function of the cardiopulmonary system. Although {RSA} is mediated by respiratory modulation of cardiac vagal outﬂow and its magnitude is used as an index of cardiac vagal activity, {RSA} itself reﬂects cardiorespiratory interaction. {RSA} is universally observed among vertebrates throughout the evolution, suggesting that it may bear an intrinsic physiological role. Recent studies have shown that {RSA} improves pulmonary gas exchange efﬁciency by matching alveolar ventilation and capillary perfusion throughout respiration cycle. This suggests that in resting animals and humans, {RSA} could save cardiac and respiratory energy by suppressing unnecessary heartbeats during expiration and ineffective ventilation during waning phases of perfusion. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating for possible dissociation between the magnitude of {RSA} and vagal control of heart rate, suggesting separated and independent regulations for respiratory modulation of cardiac vagal outﬂow from those for cardiac vagal tone. By our hypothesis, the apparent associations between {RSA} and cardiac vagal tone are explained as indirect consequences; i.e., whenever the cardiac vagal tone changes in response to the resting level of the cardiopulmonary system, {RSA} appears to change parallel to it. Our hypothesis seems more consistent with both physiological and clinical evidence about {RSA} than that presuming {RSA} is an index of cardiac vagal activity.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide ({CO}2) increases cerebral blood ﬂow and arterial blood pressure. Cerebral blood ﬂow increases not only due to the vasodilating effect of {CO}2 but also because of the increased perfusion pressure after autoregulation is exhausted. Our objective was to measure the responses of both middle cerebral artery velocity ({MCAv}) and mean arterial blood pressure ({MAP}) to {CO}2 in human subjects using Dufﬁn-type isoxic rebreathing tests. Comparisons of isoxic hyperoxic with isoxic hypoxic tests enabled the effect of oxygen tension to be determined. During rebreathing the {MCAv} response to {CO}2 was sigmoidal below a discernible threshold {CO}2 tension, increasing from a hypocapnic minimum to a hypercapnic maximum. In most subjects this threshold corresponded with the {CO}2 tension at which {MAP} began to increase. Above this threshold both {MCAv} and {MAP} increased linearly with {CO}2 tension. The sigmoidal {MCAv} response was centred at a {CO}2 tension close to normal resting values (overall mean 36 {mmHg}). While hypoxia increased the hypercapnic maximum percentage increase in {MCAv} with {CO}2 (overall means from 76.5 to 108\%) it did not affect other sigmoid parameters. Hypoxia also did not alter the supra-threshold {MCAv} and {MAP} responses to {CO}2 (overall mean slopes 5.5\% {mmHg}−1 and 2.1 {mmHg} {mmHg}−1, respectively), but did reduce the threshold (overall means from 51.5 to 46.8 {mmHg}). We concluded that in the {MCAv} response range below the threshold for the increase of {MAP} with {CO}2, the {MCAv} measurement reﬂects vascular reactivity to {CO}2 alone at a constant {MAP}.},

The oxyhemoglobin ({HbO}2) and carbamino-hemoglobin ({HbCO}2) dissociation curves computed from these equations are in good agreement with the published experimental and theoretical curves in the literature. The model solutions describe that, at standard physiological conditions, the hemoglobin is about 97.2\% saturated by O2 and the amino group of hemoglobin is about 13.1\% saturated by {CO}2. The O2 and {CO}2 content in whole blood are also calculated here from the gas solubilities, hematocrits, and the new formulas for {SHbO}2 and {SHbCO}2 .

Thirty-eight healthy elderly men (72 ± 5 yr) underwent 16 wk of heavy resistance exercise, whereas 20 healthy elderly men (72 ± 6 yr) served as nonexercising sedentary controls. Muscle biopsies were obtained pre and post training, and midway at 8 wk. Biopsies were analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence for the prevalence of myoﬁbers expressing embryonic myosin [embryonic myosin heavy chain ({MyHCe})], neonatal myosin [neonatal myosin heavy chain ({MyHCn})], nestin, and neural cell adhesion molecule ({NCAM}), and by {RT}-{qPCR} for gene expression levels of acetylcholine receptor ({AChR}) subunits, {MyHCn}, {MyHCe}, p16, and Ki67.

Changes in gene expression levels of the a1 and ɛ {AChR} subunits with 8 wk of heavy resistance exercise supports the role of this type of exercise in targeting stability of the neuromuscular junction.

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) are recognized both as damaging molecules and intracellular signaling entities. In addition to its role in {ATP} generation, the mitochondrial electron transport chain ({ETC}) constitutes a relevant source of mitochondrial {ROS}, in particular during pathological conditions. Mitochondrial {ROS} homeostasis depends on species- and site-dependent {ROS} production, their bioreactivity, diffusion, and scavenging. However, our quantitative understanding of mitochondrial {ROS} homeostasis has thus far been hampered by technical limitations, including a lack of truly site- and/or {ROS}-speciﬁc reporter molecules. In this context, the use of computational models is of great value to complement and interpret empirical data, as well as to predict variables that are difﬁcult to assess experimentally. During the past decades, various mechanistic models of {ETC}-mediated {ROS} production have been developed. Although these often-complex models have generated novel insights, their parameterization, analysis, and integration with other computational models are not straightforward. In contrast, phenomenological (sometimes termed “minimal”) models use a relatively small set of equations to describe empirical relationship(s) between {ROS}-related and other parameters and generally aim to explore system behavior and generate hypotheses for experimental validation. In this review, we ﬁrst discuss {ETC}-linked {ROS} homeostasis and introduce various detailed mechanistic models. Next, we present how bioenergetic parameters (e.g., {NADH}/{NAD} þ ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential) relate to site-speciﬁc {ROS} production within the {ETC} and how these relationships can be used to design minimal models of {ROS} homeostasis. Finally, we illustrate how minimal models have been applied to explore pathophysiological aspects of {ROS}.},

	abstract = {Ageing and lifespan are strongly affected by metabolism. The maximal possible uptake of oxygen is not only a good predictor of performance in endurance sports, but also of life expectancy. Figuratively speaking, healthy ageing is a competitive sport. Although the root cause of ageing is damage to macromolecules, it is the balance with repair processes that is decisive. Reduced or intermittent nutrition, hormones and intracellular signalling pathways that regulate metabolism have strong effects on ageing. Homeostatic regulatory processes tend to keep the environment of the cells within relatively narrow bounds. On the other hand, the body is constantly adapting to physical activity and food consumption. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and other processes indicate youth and health. A (homeo)dynamic aspect of homeostasis deteriorates with age. We are now in a position to develop computational models of human metabolism and the dynamics of heart rhythm and oxygen transport that will advance our understanding of ageing. Computational modelling of the connections between dietary restriction, metabolism and protein turnover may increase insight into homeostasis of the proteins in our body. In this way, the computational reconstruction of human physiological processes, the Physiome, can help prevent frailty and age-related disease.},

However, it is unclear how many {ORS} products comply with current World Health Organization ({WHO}) osmolality guidelines and the osmotic shelf-life stability is not known. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the within and between {ORS} product osmolality variation in both pre-mixed and reconstituted powders. Additionally, the osmotic stability was examined over time. The osmolality of ﬁve diﬀerent pre-mixed solutions and six powdered {ORS} products were measured. Pre-mixed solutions were stored at room temperatures and elevated temperatures (31 ◦C) for two months to examine osmotic shelf stability. Results demonstrated that only one pre-mixed {ORS} product was in compliance with the current guidelines both before and after the prolonged storage. Five of the six powdered {ORS} products were in compliance with minimal inter-packet variation observed within the given formulations. This investigation demonstrates that many commercially available pre-mixed {ORS} products do not currently adhere to the {WHO} recommended osmolality guidelines. Additionally, due to the presence of particular sugars and possibly other ingredients, the shelf-life stability of osmolality for certain {ORS} products may be questioned. These ﬁndings should be carefully considered in the design of future {ORS} products.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of two carbohydrate-based sports drinks on fluid intake and immunoendocrine responses to cycling. Six well-trained male cyclists completed trials on three separate days that involved cycling at 60\% V·O2peak for 90 min in hot conditions (28.161.5˚C and 52.663.1\% relative humidity). During each trial, the subjects consumed ad libitum (1) an isotonic sports drink (osmolality 317 {mOsm}/kg), (2) a hypotonic sports drink (osmolality 193 {mOsm}/kg) or (3) plain water. The cyclists consumed significantly (p,0.05) more of the isotonic drink (1.2360.35 L) and hypotonic drink (1.4460.55 L) compared with water (0.7360.26 L). Compared with water (20.9660.26 kg), body mass decreased significantly less after consuming the hypotonic drink (20.5060.38 kg) but not the isotonic drink (20.5160.41 kg). Blood glucose concentration was significantly higher at the end of the isotonic and hypotonic drink trials compared with the water trial. Neutrophil count and the plasma concentrations of catecholamines, interleukin 6 ({IL}-6), myeloperoxidase, calprotectin and myoglobin increased significantly during all three trials. {IL}-6 and calprotectin were significantly lower following the hypotonic drink trial compared with the water trial. In conclusion, hypotonic sports drinks are appealing for athletes to drink during exercise, and may help to offset fluid losses and attenuate some inflammatory responses to exercise.},

	abstract = {The volume-pressure relationship of the vasculature of the body as a whole, its vascular capacitance, requires a measurement of the mean circulatory filling pressure (Pmcf). A change in vascular capacitance induced by reflexes, hormones, or drugs has physiological consequences similar to a rapid change in blood volume and thus strongly influences cardiac output. The Pmcf is defined as the mean vascular pressure that exists after a stop in cardiac output and redistribution of blood, so that all pressures are the same throughout the system. The Pmcf is thus related to the fullness of the circulatory system. A change in Pmcf provides a uniquely useful index of a change in overall venous smooth muscle tone if the blood volume is not concomitantly changed. The Pmcf also provides an estimate of the distending pressure in the small veins and venules, which contain most of the blood in the body and comprise most of the vascular compliance. Thus the Pmcf, which is normally independent of the magnitude of the cardiac output, provides an estimate of the upstream pressure that determines the rate of flow returning to the heart.},

	abstract = {Literature from the past 168 years has been filtered to provide a unified summary of the regional distribution of cutaneous water and electrolyte losses. The former occurs via transepidermal water vapour diffusion and secretion from the eccrine sweat glands. Daily insensible water losses for a standardised individual (surface area 1.8 m2) will be 0.6–2.3 L, with the hands (80–160 g.h−1) and feet (50–150 g.h−1) losing the most, the head and neck losing intermediate amounts (40–75 g.h−1) and all remaining sites losing 15–60 g.h−1. Whilst sweat gland densities vary widely across the skin surface, this same individual would possess some 2.03 million functional glands, with the highest density on the volar surfaces of the fingers (530 glands.cm−2) and the lowest on the upper lip (16 glands. cm−2). During passive heating that results in a resting whole-body sweat rate of approximately 0.4 L.min−1, the forehead (0.99 mg.cm−2.min−1), dorsal fingers (0.62 mg.cm−2.min−1) and upper back (0.59 mg.cm−2.min−1) would display the highest sweat flows, whilst the medial thighs and anterior legs will secrete the least (both 0.12 mg.cm−2. min−1). Since sweat glands selectively reabsorb electrolytes, the sodium and chloride composition of discharged sweat varies with secretion rate. Across whole-body sweat rates from 0.72 to 3.65 mg.cm−2.min−1, sodium losses of 26.5–49.7 mmol.L−1 could be expected, with the corresponding chloride loss being 26.8–36.7 mmol.L−1. Nevertheless, there can be threefold differences in electrolyte losses across skin regions. When exercising in the heat, local sweat rates increase dramatically, with regional glandular flows becoming more homogeneous. However, intra-regional evaporative potential remains proportional to each local surface area. Thus, there is little evidence that regional sudomotor variations reflect an hierarchical distribution of sweating either at rest or during exercise.},

	abstract = {Water, the main component of the body, is distributed in the extracellular and intracellular compartments. Water exchange between these compartments is mainly governed by osmotic pressure. Extracellular water osmolarity must remain within very narrow limits to be compatible with life. Older adults lose the thirst sensation and the ability to concentrate urine, and this favours increased extracellular osmolarity (hyperosmotic stress). This situation, in turn, leads to cell dehydration, which has severe consequences for the intracellular protein structure and function and, ultimately, results in cell damage. Moreover, the fact that water determines cell volume may act as a metabolic signal, with cell swelling acting as an anabolic signal and cell shrinkage acting as a catabolic signal. Ageing also leads to a progressive loss in muscle mass and strength. Muscle strength is the main determinant of functional capacity, and, in elderly people, depends more on muscle quality than on muscle quantity (or muscle mass). Intracellular water content in lean mass has been related to muscle strength, functional capacity, and frailty risk, and has been proposed as an indicator of muscle quality and cell hydration. This review aims to assess the role of hyperosmotic stress and cell dehydration on muscle function and frailty.},

	abstract = {Background: Sodium (Na+) intake during exercise aims to replace the Na+ lost by sweat to avoid electrolyte imbalances, especially in endurance disciplines. However, Na+ needs can be very different among individuals because of the great inter-individual variability in sweat electrolyte concentration. The aim of this investigation was to determine sweat electrolyte concentration in a large group of marathoners.
Methods: A total of 157 experienced runners (141 men and 16 women) completed a marathon race (24.4 ± 3.6 °C and 27.7 ± 4.8 \% of humidity). During the race, sweat samples were collected by using sweat patches placed on the runners’ forearms. Sweat electrolyte concentration was measured by using photoelectric flame photometry.
Results: As a group, sweat Na+ concentration was 42.9 ± 18.7 mmol·L−1 (minimal-maximal value = 7.0–95.5 mmol·L−1), sweat Cl− concentration was 32.2 ± 15.6 mmol·L−1 (7.3–90.6 mmol·L−1) and sweat K+ concentration was 6.0 ± 0. 9 mmol·L−1 (3.1–8.0 mmol·L−1). Women presented lower sweat Na+ (33.9 ± 12.1 vs 44.0 ± 19.1 mmol·L−1; P = 0.04) and sweat Cl− concentrations (22.9 ± 10.5 vs 33.2 ± 15.8 mmol·L−1; P = 0.01) than men. A 20 \% of individuals presented a sweat Na+ concentration higher than 60 mmol·L−1 while this threshold was not surpassed by any female marathoner. Sweat electrolyte concentration did not correlate to sweat rate, age, body characteristics, experience or training. Although there was a significant correlation between sweat Na+ concentration and running pace (r = 0.18; P = 0.03), this association was weak to interpret that sweat Na+ concentration increased with running pace.
Conclusions: The inter-individual variability in sweat electrolyte concentration was not explained by any individual characteristics except for individual running pace and sex. An important portion (20 \%) of marathoners might need special sodium intake recommendations due to their high sweat salt losses.},

	abstract = {Human thermoregulation and acclimatization are core components of the human coping mechanism for withstanding variations in environmental heat exposure. Amidst growing recognition that curtailing global warming to less than two degrees is becoming increasing improbable, human survival will require increasing reliance on these mechanisms. The projected several fold increase in extreme heat events suggests we need to recalibrate health protection policies and ratchet up adaptation efforts. Climate researchers, epidemiologists, and policy makers engaged in climate change adaptation and health protection are not commonly drawn from heat physiology backgrounds. Injecting a scholarly consideration of physiological limitations to human heat tolerance into the adaptation and policy literature allows for a broader understanding of heat health risks to support effective human adaptation and adaptation planning. This paper details the physiological and external environmental factors that determine human thermoregulation and acclimatization. We present a model to illustrate the interrelationship between elements that modulate the physiological process of thermoregulation. Limitations inherent in these processes, and the constraints imposed by differing exposure levels, and thermal comfort seeking on achieving acclimatization, are then described. Combined, these limitations will restrict the likely contribution that acclimatization can play in future human adaptation to global warming. We postulate that behavioral and technological adaptations will need to become the dominant means for human individual and societal adaptations as global warming progresses.},

Specific hormonal, inflammatory, and nutritional-metabolic factors may play key roles in {CKD} development and pathogenesis. These include raised proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and −6, tumor necrosis factor, altered hepatic acute phase proteins, including reduced albumin, increased C-reactive protein, and perturbations in normal anabolic hormone responses with reduced growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 axis activity. Others include hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system ({RAAS}), with angiotensin {II} and aldosterone implicated in hypertension and the promotion of insulin resistance, and subsequent pharmacological blockade shown to improve blood pressure, metabolic control and offer reno-protective effects. Abnormal adipocytokine levels including leptin and adiponectin may further promote the insulin resistant, and proinflammatory state in {CKD}. Ghrelin may be also implicated and controversial studies suggest activities may be reduced in human {CKD}, and may provide a rationale for administration of acyl-ghrelin. Poor vitamin D status has also been associated with patient outcome and {CVD} risk and may indicate a role for supplementation. Glucocorticoid activities traditionally known for their involvement in the pathogenesis of a number of disease states are increased and may be implicated in {CKD}-associated hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes risk and cachexia, both directly and indirectly through effects on other systems including activation of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Insight into the multiple factors altered in {CKD} may provide useful information on disease pathogenesis, clinical assessment and treatment rationale such as potential pharmacological, nutritional and exercise therapies.},

	abstract = {Total body potassium content and proper distribution of potassium across the cell membrane is of critical importance for normal cellular function. Potassium homeostasis is maintained by several different methods. In the kidney, total body potassium content is achieved by alterations in renal excretion of potassium in response to variations in intake. Insulin and beta-adrenergic tone play critical roles in maintaining the internal distribution of potassium under normal conditions. Despite homeostatic pathways designed to maintain potassium levels within the normal range, disorders of altered potassium homeostasis are common. The clinical approach to designing effective treatments relies on understanding the pathophysiology and regulatory influences which govern the internal distribution and external balance of potassium. Here we provide an overview of the key regulatory aspects of normal potassium physiology. This review is designed to provide an overview of potassium homeostasis as well as provide references of seminal papers to guide the reader into a more in depth discussion of the importance of potassium balance. This review is designed to be a resource for educators and well-informed clinicians who are teaching trainees about the importance of potassium balance.},

We hypothesized that this difficulty is rooted in a student’s misunderstanding of virtual volume. This was tested by having students select from several drawings the one they thought plasma would look like after a certain volume of it has been cleared of sodium by the kidneys. About half the participating students selected plasma pictured as having a certain volume of it devoid of sodium molecules. That is, their misconception of clearance seemed to be due to a lack of understanding about virtual volume, a deficiency which is reinforced by the classic definition of clearance. To address this misconception, a demonstration was devised in which a beaker of concentrated colored water was used to represent plasma before renal clearance, a beaker of the same concentrated colored water in which the top third had been replaced by clear mineral oil was used to represent what the definition of clearance said would happen to plasma after a third of it had been cleared of sodium, and a beaker of dilute colored water was used to represent what really happens to plasma when a certain volume of it is cleared of a solute. Incorporating this demonstration into discussions of renal clearance helped students to understand this concept, as evidenced by improved scores on related questions.},

Plasma renin was markedly elevated. Plasma Na and K concentrations were unchanged until the 4th day of Na depletion at which time plasma Na was decreased and plasma K was elevated. The Na content of the adrenal cortex expressed as fat-free tissue solids was decreased. It seems likely that the adrenocortical Na loss was extracellular; adrenocortical K content was unaltered. It is suggested that the normal rate of corticosterone secretion during Na depletion is maintained by a negative corticosteroid feedback mechanism, since corticosterone output was consistently increased in Na-depleted hypophysectomized dogs. Aldosterone secretion was three times as great in the presence as in the absence of the anterior pituitary during Na depletion. It is concluded that increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system is the primary mechanism leading to hyperaldosteronism during Na depletion and that the adenohypophysis plays an important supportive role.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological studies of the human heart face the fundamental challenge that experimental data can be acquired only from patients with underlying heart disease. Regarding human atria, there exist sizable gaps in the understanding of the functional role of cellular Ca2+ dynamics, which differ crucially from that of ventricular cells, in the modulation of excitation-contraction coupling. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model of the human atrial myocyte that, in addition to the sarcolemmal ({SL}) ion currents, accounts for the heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics emerging from a structurally detailed sarcoplasmic reticulum ({SR}). Based on the simulation results, our model convincingly reproduces the principal characteristics of Ca2+ dynamics: 1) the biphasic increment during the upstroke of the Ca2+ transient resulting from the delay between the peripheral and central {SR} Ca2+ release, and 2) the relative contribution of {SL} Ca2+ current and {SR} Ca2+ release to the Ca2+ transient. In line with experimental findings, the model also replicates the strong impact of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics on the shape of the action potential. The simulation results suggest that the peripheral {SR} Ca2+ release sites define the interface between Ca2+ and {AP}, whereas the central release sites are important for the fire-diffuse-fire propagation of Ca2+ diffusion. Furthermore, our analysis predicts that the modulation of the action potential duration due to increasing heart rate is largely mediated by changes in the intracellular Na+ concentration. Finally, the results indicate that the {SR} Ca2+ release is a strong modulator of {AP} duration and, consequently, myocyte refractoriness/ excitability. We conclude that the developed model is robust and reproduces many fundamental aspects of the tight coupling between {SL} ion currents and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Thus, the model provides a useful framework for future studies of excitation-contraction coupling in human atrial myocytes.},

	abstract = {It is well acknowledged that muscles that are elongated while activated (i.e., eccentric muscle action) are stronger and require less energy (per unit of force) than muscles that are shortening (i.e., concentric contraction) or that remain at a constant length (i.e., isometric contraction). Although the cross-bridge theory of muscle contraction provides a good explanation for the increase in force in active muscle lengthening, it does not explain the residual increase in force following active lengthening (residual force enhancement), or except with additional assumptions, the reduced metabolic requirement of muscle during and following active stretch. Aside from the cross-bridge theory, 2 other primary explanations for the mechanical properties of actively stretched muscles have emerged: (1) the so-called sarcomere length nonuniformity theory and (2) the engagement of a passive structural element theory. In this article, these theories are discussed, and it is shown that the last of these—the engagement of a passive structural element in eccentric muscle action—offers a simple and complete explanation for many hitherto unexplained observations in actively lengthening muscle. Although by no means fully proven, the theory has great appeal for its simplicity and beauty, and even if over time it is shown to be wrong, it nevertheless forms a useful framework for direct hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {An a priori model of the whole active muscle length-tension relationship was constructed utilizing only myoﬁlament length and serial sarcomere number for rabbit tibialis anterior ({TA}), extensor digitorum longus ({EDL}), and extensor digitorum {II} ({EDII}) muscles. Passive tension was modeled with a two-element Hill-type model. Experimental length-tension relations were then measured for each of these muscles and compared to predictions. The model was able to accurately capture the activetension characteristics of experimentally-measured data for all muscles ({ICC}¼ 0.88 70.03). Despite their varied architecture, no differences in predicted versus experimental correlations were observed among muscles. In addition, the model demonstrated that excursion, quantiﬁed by full-width-at-halfmaximum ({FWHM}) of the active length-tension relationship, scaled linearly (slope ¼0.68) with normalized muscle ﬁber length. Experimental and theoretical {FWHM} values agreed well with an intraclass correlation coefﬁcient of 0.99 (p o 0.001). In contrast to active tension, the passive tension model deviated from experimentally-measured values and thus, was not an accurate predictor of passive tension ({ICC} ¼0.70 7 0.07). These data demonstrate that modeling muscle as a scaled sarcomere provides accurate active functional but not passive functional predictions for rabbit {TA}, {EDL}, and {EDII} muscles and call into question the need for more complex modeling assumptions often proposed.},

	title = {What Can We Learn from Single Sarcomere and Myoﬁbril Preparations?},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Sarcomeres are the smallest functional contractile unit of muscle, and myoﬁbrils are striated muscle organelles that are comprised of sarcomeres that are strictly aligned in series. Furthermore, passive forces in sarcomeres and myoﬁbrils are almost exclusively produced by the structural protein titin, and all contractile, regulatory, and structural proteins are in their natural conﬁguration. For these mechanical and structural reasons single sarcomere and myoﬁbril preparations are arguably the most powerful to answer questions on the mechanisms of striated muscle contraction. We developed and optimized single myoﬁbril research over the past 20 years and were the ﬁrst to mechanically isolate and test single sarcomeres. The results from this research led to the uncovering of the crucial role of titin in muscle contraction, ﬁrst molecular explanations for the origins of the passive and the residual force enhancement properties of skeletal and cardiac muscles, the discovery of sarcomere length stability on the descending limb of the force-length relationship, and culminating in the formulation of the three-ﬁlament theory of muscle contraction that, aside from actin and myosin, proposes a crucial role of titin in active force production. Aside from all the advantages and possibilities that single sarcomere and myoﬁbril preparations offer, there are also disadvantages. These include the fragility of the preparation, the time-consuming training to master these preparations, the limited spatial resolution for length and force measurements, and the unavailability of commercial systems for single sarcomere/myoﬁbril research. Ignoring the mechanics that govern serially linked systems, not considering the spatial resolution and associated accuracies of myoﬁbril systems, and neglecting the fragility of myoﬁbril preparations, has led to erroneous interpretations of results and misleading conclusions. Here, we will attempt to describe the methods and possible applications of single sarcomere/myoﬁbril research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages by focusing on speciﬁc applications. It is hoped that this discussion may contribute to identifying the enormous potential of single sarcomere/myoﬁbril research in discovering the secrets of muscle contraction.},

	abstract = {The lengths of a muscle’s sarcomeres are a primary determinant of its ability to contract and produce force. In addition, sarcomere length is a critical parameter that is required to make meaningful comparisons of both the force-generating and excursion capacities of different muscles. Until recently, in vivo sarcomere length data have been limited to invasive or intraoperative measurement techniques. With the advent of second harmonic generation microendoscopy, minimally invasive measures of sarcomere length can be made for the ﬁrst time. This imaging technique expands our ability to study muscle adaptation due to changes in stimulus, use, or disease. However, due to past inability to measure sarcomeres outside of surgery or biopsy, little is known about the natural, anatomical variability in sarcomere length in living human subjects. To develop robust experimental protocols that ensure data provide accurate representations of a muscle’s sarcomere lengths, we sought to quantify experimental uncertainty associated with in vivo measures of sarcomere lengths. Speciﬁcally, we assessed the variability in sarcomere length measured (1) within a single image, along a muscle ﬁber, (2) across images captured within a single trial, across trials, and across days, as well as (3) across locations in the muscle using second harmonic generation in two upper limb muscles with different muscle architectures, functions, and sizes. Across all of our measures of variability we estimate that the magnitude of the uncertainty for in vivo sarcomere length is on the order of ∼0.25 µm. In the two upper limb muscles studied we found larger variability in sarcomere lengths within a single insertion than across locations. We also developed custom code to make measures of sarcomere length variability across a single ﬁber and determined that this codes’ accuracy is an order of magnitude smaller than our measurement uncertainty due to sarcomere variability. Together, our ﬁndings provide guidance for the development of robust experimental design and analysis of in vivo sarcomere lengths in the upper limb.},

The maximal possible uptake of oxygen is not only a good predictor of performance in endurance sports, but also of life expectancy. Figuratively speaking, healthy ageing is a competitive sport. Although the root cause of ageing is damage to macromolecules, it is the balance with repair processes that is decisive. Reduced or intermittent nutrition, hormones and intracellular signalling pathways that regulate metabolism have strong effects on ageing. Homeostatic regulatory processes tend to keep the environment of the cells within relatively narrow bounds. On the other hand, the body is constantly adapting to physical activity and food consumption. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and other processes indicate youth and health. A (homeo)dynamic aspect of homeostasis deteriorates with age. We are now in a position to develop computational models of human metabolism and the dynamics of heart rhythm and oxygen transport that will advance our understanding of ageing. Computational modelling of the connections between dietary restriction, metabolism and protein turnover may increase insight into homeostasis of the proteins in our body. In this way, the computational reconstruction of human physiological processes, the Physiome, can help prevent frailty and age-related disease.},

J Strength Cond Res {XX}(X): 000–000, 2021—The purpose of this study was to compare normalized net joint moments ({NJMs}), moment arms, and muscle activity in the bench press exercise between powerlifters and recreationally strengthtrained lifters and between women and men. Thirty-four healthy adults, including 12 powerlifters (6 women and 6 men) and 22 recreational lifters (9 women and 13 men), performed a 6–8 repetition maximum set of the bench press, while elbow and shoulder {NJMs} and moment arms and electromyographic ({EMG}) activity of 6 upper extremity muscles were recorded. The results showed that training expertise and sex affected bench press technique substantially. Powerlifters applied a different bar path which impacted joint kinematics to a greater extent and joint kinetics to a lesser extent. Specifically, powerlifters had lower normalized peak elbow {NJMs} and shorter joint {ROMs} than recreational lifters (p \# 0.05), yet no differences in normalized shoulder {NJMs} and muscle activity were observed. Women showed lower normalized mean shoulder {NJMs}, higher normalized peak elbow {NJMs}, and higher mean elbow to shoulder {NJM} ratios than men (p \# 0.05). The muscle activity of the long head of the triceps brachii and the elbow to shoulder {EMG} ratio were higher, yet muscle activity of the sternocostal and abdominal head of the pectoralis major was lower for female than for male subjects (p \# 0.05). In conclusion, powerlifters and men are more shoulder dominant when performing the bench press than recreational lifters and women, respectively. These findings will have implications for resistance training program design, expected training adaptations and bench press performance.},

	abstract = {Neuromuscular fatigue is deﬁned as a reduction induced by exercise in the maximal voluntary force that a muscle or group of muscles can generate. An accumulation of work or an incomplete force restoration can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the neuromuscular performance in both the short and long terms. Thus, fatigue management is essential for controlling the training adaptations of athletes and reducing their susceptibility to injury and illness. The main individualized monitoring tools used to describe fatigue are questionnaires and subjective assessments of fatigue, biochemical markers, sprint tests, and vertical jump tests. Among the subjective measures, the rating of the perceived exertion has been widely used because of its simplicity and high validity. In terms of the objective measures, one of the more frequently employed tools by practitioners to assess neuromuscular fatigue is the countermovement jump. Because of its high validity and reliability, it is accepted as the reference standard test in sports, in general, and particularly in team sports. Our review aims to clarify how all these indicators, as well as several devices, can help coaches in different sports contexts to monitor neuromuscular fatigue, and how these procedures should be used to obtain data that can be used to make decisions in complex environments.},

J Strength Cond Res 27(2): 477–484, 2013—Kettlebells are a popular implement in many strength and conditioning programs, and their beneﬁts are touted in popular literature, books, and videos. However, clinical data on their efﬁcacy are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine whether kettlebell training transfers strength and power to weightlifting and powerlifting exercises and improves muscular endurance. Thirty-seven subjects were assigned to an experimental ({EXP}, n = 23; mean age = 40.9 6 12.9 years) or a control group ({CON}; n = 14; mean age = 39.6 6 15.8 years), range 18–72 years. The participants were required to perform assessments including a barbell clean and jerk, barbell bench press, maximal vertical jump, and 458 back extensions to volitional fatigue before and after a 10-week kettlebell training program. Training was structured in a group setting for 2 d\$wk21 for 10 weeks. A repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to determine group 3 time interactions and main effects. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted when appropriate. Bench press revealed a time 3 group interaction and a main effect (p , 0.05). Clean and jerk and back extension demonstrated a trend toward a time 3 group interaction, but it did not reach signiﬁcance (p = 0.053). However, clean and jerk did reveal a main effect for time (p , 0.05). No signiﬁcant ﬁndings were reported for maximal vertical jump. The results demonstrate a transfer of power and strength in response to 10 weeks of training with kettlebells. Traditional training methods may not be convenient or accessible for strength and conditioning specialists, athletes, coaches, and recreational exercisers. The current data suggest that kettlebells may be an effective alternative tool to improve performance in weightlifting and powerlifting.},

Recent work suggests that the titin spring contributes to muscle contraction in a more active manner than previously thought. In this review, we highlight this property, specifically the ability of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains of titin to undergo unfolding-refolding transitions when isolated titin molecules or skeletal myofibrils are held at physiological force levels. Folding of titin Ig domains under force is a hitherto unappreciated, putative source of work production in muscle cells, which could work in synergy with the actomyosin system to maximize the energy delivered by a stretched, actively contracting muscle. This review also focuses on the mechanisms shown to modulate titin-based viscoelastic forces in skeletal muscle cells, including chaperone binding, titin oxidation, phosphorylation, Ca

              binding, and interaction with actin filaments. Along the way, we discuss which of these modulatory mechanisms might contribute to the phenomenon of residual force enhancement relevant for eccentric muscle contractions. Finally, a brief perspective is added on the potential for the alterations in titin-based force to dynamically alter mechano-chemical signaling pathways in the muscle cell. We conclude that titin from skeletal muscle is a determinant of both passive and active tension and a bona fide mechanosensor, whose stiffness is tuned by various independent mechanisms.},

            The purpose of this perspective is to present a general theory—the Physical Stress Theory ({PST}). The basic premise of the {PST} is that changes in the relative level of physical stress cause a predictable adaptive response in all biological tissue. Specific thresholds define the upper and lower stress levels for each characteristic tissue response. Qualitatively, the 5 tissue responses to physical stress are decreased stress tolerance (eg, atrophy), maintenance, increased stress tolerance (eg, hypertrophy), injury, and death. Fundamental principles of tissue adaptation to physical stress are described that, in the authors' opinion, can be used to help guide physical therapy practice, education, and research. The description of fundamental principles is followed by a review of selected literature describing adaptation to physical stress for each of the 4 main organ systems described in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice (ie, cardiovascular/pulmonary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuromuscular). Limitations and implications of the {PST} for practice, research, and education are presented.},

In our derivation of the definition of life we have assumed the hypothesis, that during the emergence of life evolution had to first involve autocatalytic systems that only subsequently acquired the capacity of genetic heredity. The new proposed definition of life is independent of the mode of evolution, regardless of whether Lamarckian or Darwinian evolution operated at the origins of life and throughout evolutionary history. The new definition of life presented herein is formulated in a minimal manner and it is general enough that it does not distinguish between individual (metabolic) network and the collective (ecological) one. The newly proposed definition of life may be of interest for astrobiology, research into the origins of life or for efforts to produce synthetic or artificial life, and it furthermore may also have implications in the cognitive and computer sciences.},

Theoretical studies show that using either “mixed” feedback or multiple negative feedback loops with different delays, it is possible to generate complex periodic and aperiodic, chaotic rhythms. In an experimental study of finger tracking using visual feedback, a variable time delay can be added to the feedback circuit. As this delay is varied, complex rhythms of finger displacement are observed. We suggest that the complex dynamics observed in diverse physiological systems in normal individuals may be associated with chaotic dynamics arising from the interaction of multiple feedback loops.},

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the morphological and functional perturbations in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments of the {NMJ} remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the role of the metabolic pathway associated to the kinase {TOR} (Target of Rapamycin) in the development, maintenance and alterations of the {NMJ}.

We hypothesize that upon muscle activation, formation of actomyosin crossbridges reduces the force on titin causing entropic recoil of the titin polymer and triggering the folding of the titin Ig domains. In the physiological force range of 4–15 {pN} under which titin operates in muscle, the folding contraction of a single Ig domain can generate 200\% of the work of entropic recoil, and occurs at forces which exceed the maximum stalling force of single myosin motors. Thus titin operates like a mechanical battery storing elastic energy efficiently by unfolding Ig domains, and delivering the charge back by folding when the motors are activated during a contraction.

	abstract = {Extracellular matrix ({ECM}) structures within skeletal muscle play an important, but underappreciated, role in muscle development, function and adaptation. Each individual muscle is surrounded by epimysial connective tissue and within the muscle there are two distinct extracellular matrix ({ECM}) structures, the perimysium and endomysium. Together, these three {ECM} structures make up the intramuscular connective tissue ({IMCT}). There are large variations in the amount and composition of {IMCT} between functionally different muscles. Although {IMCT} acts as a scaffold for muscle ﬁber development and growth and acts as a carrier for blood vessels and nerves to the muscle cells, the variability in {IMCT} between different muscles points to a role in the variations in active and passive mechanical properties of muscles. Some traditional measures of the contribution of endomysial {IMCT} to passive muscle elasticity relied upon tensile measurements on single ﬁber preparations. These types of measurements may now be thought to be missing the important point that endomysial {IMCT} networks within a muscle fascicle coordinate forces and displacements between adjacent muscle cells by shear and that active contractile forces can be transmitted by this route (myofascial force transmission). The amount and geometry of the perimysial {ECM} network separating muscle fascicles varies more between different muscle than does the amount of endomysium. While there is some evidence for myofascial force transmission between fascicles via the perimysium, the variations in this {ECM} network appears to be linked to the amount of shear displacements between fascicles that must necessarily occur when the whole muscle contracts and changes shape. Fast growth of muscle by ﬁber hypertrophy is not always associated with a high turnover of {ECM} components, but slower rates of growth and muscle wasting may be associated with {IMCT} remodeling. A hypothesis arising from this observation is that the level of cell signaling via shear between integrin and dystroglycan linkages on the surface of the muscle cells and the overlying endomysium may be the controlling factor for {IMCT} turnover, although this idea is yet to be tested.},

	abstract = {Creatine (Cr) is beneﬁcial for increasing muscle mass and preventing muscle atrophy via involving in energy metabolism through the Cr and phosphocreatine ({PCr}) system. This study aimed to evaluate the supplemental effect of Cr on protein metabolism under normal and starvation conditions. The primary myoblasts were obtained from the breast muscle of chicks. The mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR})/P70S6 kinase (P70S6K), ubiquitin-proteasome ({UP}) pathways, and mitochondrial function of myotubes were evaluated at normal or starvation state and with or without glucose supplementation. Under normal condition, Cr supplementation enhanced protein synthesis rate as well as upregulated the total and phosphorylated P70S6K expressions. Cr had little inﬂuence on protein catabolism and mitochondrial function. In a starvation state, however, Cr alleviated myotube atrophy and enhanced protein accretion by inhibiting Atrogin1 and myostatin ({MSTN}) expression. Furthermore, Cr treatment upregulated the transcriptional coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c coactivator-1a ({PGC}-1a) expression and decreased reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) accumulation under starvation condition. In the presence of glucose, however, the favorable effect of Cr on protein content and myotube diameter did not occur under starvation condition. The present result indicates that at a normal state, Cr stimulated protein synthesis via the {mTOR}/P70S6K pathway. In a starvation state, Cr mainly takes a favorable effect on protein accumulation via suppression of the {UP} pathway and mediated mitochondrial function mainly by serving as an energy supplier. The result highlights the potential clinical application for the modulation of muscle mass under different nutritional conditions.},

Porter and his laboratory defined the  {SR}, the unique junctions between {SR} and T tubules, and the continuity between T  tubules and surface membrane. Current research in this area centers on the  interaction between T tubules and {SR}. This is mediated by 2 well-identified  calcium channels: the dihydropyridine receptors ({DHPRs}) that act as voltage  sensors in the T tubules, and the ryanodine receptors ({RyRs}) or calcium release  channels of the {SR}. The relative positions of these 2 molecules differ  significantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and this correlates well with known  functional differences in the control of contraction. Molecular biology  experiments combined with {EM} indicate that {DHPRs} are linked to {RyRs} in skeletal  but probably not in cardiac muscle.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle atrophy attributable to muscular inactivity has significant adverse functional consequences. While the initiating physiological event leading to atrophy seems to be the loss of muscle tension and a good deal of the physiology of muscle atrophy has been characterized, little is known about the triggers or the molecular signaling events underlying this process. Decreases in protein synthesis and increases in protein degradation both have been shown to contribute to muscle protein loss due to disuse, and recent work has delineated elements of both synthetic and proteolytic processes underlying muscle atrophy. It is also becoming evident that interactions among known proteolytic pathways (ubiquitin-proteasome, lysosomal, and calpain) are involved in muscle proteolysis during atrophy. Factors such as {TNF}-α, glucocorticoids, myostatin, and reactive oxygen species can induce muscle protein loss under specified conditions. Also, it is now apparent that the transcription factor {NF}-κB is a key intracellular signal transducer in disuse atrophy. Transcriptional profiles of atrophying muscle show both up- and downregulation of various genes over time, thus providing further evidence that there are multiple concurrent processes involved in muscle atrophy. The purpose of this review is to synthesize our current understanding of the molecular regulation of muscle atrophy. We also discuss how ongoing work should uncover more about the molecular underpinnings of muscle wasting, particularly that due to disuse.},

	abstract = {Water drinking elicits profound pressor responses in patients with impaired baroreflex function and in sinoaortic-denervated mice. Healthy subjects show more subtle changes in heart rate and blood pressure with water drinking. The water-induced pressor response appears to be mediated through sympathetic nervous system activation at the spinal level. Indeed, water drinking raises resting energy expenditure in normal weight and obese subjects. The stimulus setting off the response is hypoosmolarity rather than water temperature or gastrointestinal stretch. Studies in mice suggest that this osmopressor response may involve transient receptor potential vanniloid 4 (Trpv4) receptors. However, the (nerve) cell population serving as peripheral osmosensors and the exact transduction mechanisms are still unknown. The osmopressor response can be exploited in the treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension in patients with severe autonomic failure. Furthermore, the osmopressor response acutely improves orthostatic tolerance in healthy subjects and in patients with neurally mediated syncope. The phenomenon should be recognized as an important confounder in cardiovascular and metabolic studies.},

Various structural, signaling, and mechanical functions have been associated with titin, but not all of these are fully elucidated and accepted in the scientific community. Here, I discuss the primary mechanical functions of titin, including its accepted role in passive force production, stabilization of half-sarcomeres and sarcomeres, and its controversial contribution to residual force enhancement, passive force enhancement, energetics, and work production in shortening muscle. Finally, I provide evidence that titin is a molecular spring whose stiffness changes with muscle activation and actin–myosin-based force production, suggesting a novel model of force production that, aside from actin and myosin, includes titin as a Bthird contractile{\textasciicircum} filament. Using this threefilament model of sarcomeres, the stability of (half-) sarcomeres, passive force enhancement, residual force enhancement, and the decrease in metabolic energy during and following eccentric contractions can be explained readily.},

	abstract = {Objective: It remains unknown whether myonuclei remain elevated post anabolic-androgenic steroid ({AAS}) usage in humans. Limited data exist on {AAS}-induced changes in gene expression. Design: Cross-sectional/longitudinal. Setting: University. Participants: Fifty-six men aged 20 to 42 years. Independent Variables: Non–resistance-trained (C) or resistance-trained ({RT}), {RT} currently using {AAS} ({RT}-{AS}), of which if {AAS} usage ceased for \$18 weeks resampled as Returning Participants ({RP}) or {RT} previously using {AAS} ({PREV}). Main Outcome Measures: Myonuclei per fiber and cross-sectional area ({CSA}) of trapezius muscle fibers. Results: There were no significant differences between C (n 5 5), {RT} (n 5 15), {RT}-{AS} (n 5 17), and {PREV} (n 5 6) for myonuclei per fiber. Three of 5 returning participants ({RP}1-3) were biopsied twice. Before visit 1, {RP}1 ceased {AAS} usage 34 weeks before, {RP}2 and {RP}3 ceased {AAS} usage \#2 weeks before, and all had 28 weeks between visits. Fiber {CSA} decreased for {RP}1 and {RP}2 between visits (7566 vs 6629 mm2; 7854 vs 5677 mm2) while myonuclei per fiber remained similar (3.5 vs 3.4; 2.5 vs 2.6). Respectively, these values increased for {RP}3 between visits (7167 vs 7889 mm2; 2.6 vs 3.3). Conclusions: This cohort of past {AAS} users did not have elevated myonuclei per fiber values, unlike previous research, but reported {AAS} usage was much lower. Training and {AAS} usage history also varied widely among participants. Comparable myonuclei per fiber numbers despite decrements in fiber {CSA} postexposure adheres with the muscle memory mechanism, but there is variation in usage relative to sampling date and low numbers of returning participants.},

	abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine if ﬁber arrangement was responsible for differences in the whole muscle mechanical properties. Experiments were carried out in situ in blood perfused dog skeletal muscles at approximately normal body temperature between 36° and 38°C. The following mechanical relationships were studied using a pneumatic muscle lever to measure Tension (P), length (L) and {dP}/dt: and {dL}/dt with a high frequency oscillograph (500–1000 Hz): 1.) Length:Tension; 2.) Force:Velocity; and 3.) Stress:Strain of Series Elastic. Electron microscopy and ﬁber typing were done as adjunctive studies. Muscles were stimulated by direct nerve stimulation with 0.1msec stimuli at a rate of 1 impulse per second for twitch contractions, or in 200 msec bursts of 100 Hz 0.1 msec stimuli for brief tetanic contractions. The pennate short ﬁbered gastrocnemius plantaris developed 1.0 kg/g of tension during brief tetanic stimulation, at optimal length (Lo) with full stimulus voltage, while the parallel long ﬁbered semitendinosus developed 0.5 kg/g under the same conditions. The Length:Tension relationship for these two muscles was qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. The Force:Velocity relationship (ΔL/L0 vs. P/P0) for both muscles were also qualitatively similar and could be described by the previously proposed rectangular hyperbola but a better predicted ﬁt to the observed data could be produced by adding a descending exponential function to the rectangular hyperbola. Unlike previous studies, the Stress: Strain properties of the series elastic component measured by quick release (ΔL/Li vs. ΔP/ Po) were linear and gastrocnemius was 25 per cent higher than the semitendinosus. Overall, both muscles were found to have mechanical properties that differed little from the previously reported literature for amphibian, cardiac and small mammalian muscles studied by others in vitro. The major differences that we found were in the shapes of the force:velocity curve of the contractile component, and the Stress:Strain curve of series elastic component. Equations and explanations for these differences are devised and presented.},

Six male powerlifters ({POW}) (height: 179.2 6 7.8 cm; mass: 87.1 6 8.0 kg; age: 21–33 years) of international level, 6 male Olympic weightlifters ({OLY}) (height: 176.7 6 7.7 cm; mass: 83.1 6 13 kg; age: 22–30 years) of national level, and 6 recreationally trained male athletes (height: 181.9 6 8.7 cm; mass: 87.9 6 15.3 kg; age: 23–33 years) performed the {LBBS}, {HBBS}, and both {LBBS} and {HBBS} (respectively) up to and including 100\% 1RM. Small to moderate (d = 0.2–0.5) effect size differences were observed between the {POW} and {OLY} in joint angles and Fv, although none were statistically signiﬁcant. However, signiﬁcant joint angle results were observed between the experienced {POW}/{OLY} and the recreationally trained group. Our ﬁndings suggest that practitioners seeking to place emphasis on the stronger hip musculature should consider the {LBBS}. Also, when the goal is to lift the greatest load possible, the {LBBS} may be preferable. Conversely, the {HBBS} is more suited to replicate movements that exhibit a more upright torso position, such as the snatch and clean, or to place more emphasis on the associated musculature of the knee joint.},

	abstract = {In this study we examined how the strain energies within a muscle are related to changes in longitudinal force when the muscle is exposed to an external transverse load. We implemented a three-dimensional (3D) ﬁnite element model of contracting muscle using the principle of minimum total energy and allowing the redistribution of energy through different strain energy-densities. This allowed us to determine the importance of the strain energy-densities to the transverse forces developed by the muscle. We ran a series of in silica experiments on muscle blocks varying in initial pennation angle, muscle length, and external transverse load. As muscle contracts it maintains a near constant volume. As such, any changes in muscle length are balanced by deformations in the transverse directions such as muscle thickness or muscle width. Muscle develops transverse forces as it expands. In many situations external forces act to counteract these transverse forces and the muscle responds to external transverse loads while both passive and active. The muscle blocks used in our simulations decreased in thickness and pennation angle when passively compressed and pushed back on the load when they were activated. Activation of the compressed muscle blocks led either to an increase or decrease in muscle thickness depending on whether the initial pennation angle was less than or greater than 15◦, respectively. Furthermore, the strain energy increased and redistributed across the different strainenergy potentials during contraction. The volumetric strain energy-density varied with muscle length and pennation angle and was reduced with greater transverse load for most initial muscle lengths and pennation angles. External transverse load reduced the longitudinal muscle force for initial pennation angles of β0 = 0◦. Whereas for pennate muscle (β0 {\textgreater} 0◦) longitudinal force changed (increase or decrease) depending on the muscle length, pennation angle and the direction of the external load relative to the muscle ﬁbres. For muscle blocks with initial pennation angles β0 ≤ 20◦ the reduction in longitudinal muscle force coincided with a reduction in volumetric strain energy-density.},

	abstract = {During contraction the energy of muscle tissue increases due to energy from the hydrolysis of {ATP}. This energy is distributed across the tissue as strain-energy potentials in the contractile elements, strain-energy potential from the 3D deformation of the base-material tissue (containing cellular and extracellular matrix effects), energy related to changes in the muscle’s nearly incompressible volume and external work done at the muscle surface. Thus, energy is redistributed through the muscle’s tissue as it contracts, with only a component of this energy being used to do mechanical work and develop forces in the muscle’s longitudinal direction. Understanding how the strain-energy potentials are redistributed through the muscle tissue will help enlighten why the mechanical performance of whole muscle in its longitudinal direction does not match the performance that would be expected from the contractile elements alone. Here we demonstrate these physical effects using a 3D muscle model based on the ﬁnite element method. The tissue deformations within contracting muscle are large, and so the mechanics of contraction were explained using the principles of continuum mechanics for large deformations. We present simulations of a contracting medial gastrocnemius muscle, showing tissue deformations that mirror observations from magnetic resonance imaging. This paper tracks the redistribution of strain-energy potentials through the muscle tissue during ﬁxed-end contractions, and shows how ﬁbre shortening, pennation angle, transverse bulging and anisotropy in the stress and strain of the muscle tissue are all related to the interaction between the material properties of the muscle and the action of the contractile elements.},

	abstract = {During muscle contraction, chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy when {ATP} is hydrolysed during cross-bridge cycling. This mechanical energy is then distributed and stored in the tissue as the muscle deforms or is used to perform external work. We previously showed how energy is distributed through contracting muscle during ﬁxed-end contractions; however, it is not clear how the distribution of tissue energy is altered by the kinetic energy of muscle mass during dynamic contractions. In this study we conducted simulations of a 3D continuum muscle model that accounts for tissue mass, as well as force-velocity effects, in which the muscle underwent sinusoidal work-loop contractions coupled with bursts of excitation. We found that increasing muscle size, and therefore mass, increased the kinetic energy per unit volume of the muscle. In addition to greater relative kinetic energy per cycle, relatively more energy was also stored in the aponeurosis, and less was stored in the base material, which represented the intra and extracellular tissue components apart from the myoﬁbrils. These energy changes in larger muscles due to greater mass were associated lower mass-speciﬁc mechanical work output per cycle, and this reduction in mass-speciﬁc work was greatest for smaller initial pennation angles. When we compared the effects of mass on the model tissue behaviour to that of in situ muscle with added mass during comparable work-loop trials, we found that greater mass led to lower maximum and higher minimum acceleration in the longitudinal (x) direction near the middle of the muscle compared to at the non-ﬁxed end, which indicates that greater mass contributes to tissue non-uniformity in whole muscle. These comparable results for the simulated and in situ muscle also show that this modelling framework behaves in ways that are consistent with experimental muscle. Overall, the results of this study highlight that muscle mass is an important determinant of whole muscle behaviour.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 633–640, 2022—The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 3 vs. 5 days of training cessation on body composition, perceived recovery and stress state, and maximal strength. Nineteen strength-trained athletes (23.8 6 4.1 year; 90.8 6 20.7 kg; 174.2 6 7.3 cm) completed a powerlifting specific 4-week training block followed by either 3 or 5 days of training cessation. During the 4-week training block, athletes were trained 3 days per week, performing 3–4 movements that included at least 2–3 competition lifts per session while performing 4–5 sets of 3–5 repetitions with intensity ranging from 75 to 100\% 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Body composition, psychometric measures, upper-body maximal strength, and lower-body maximal strength were assessed before (T1) and after 4 weeks of training (T2) and at 3 or 5 days of training cessation (T3). The alpha level was set at p , 0.05. After the 4-week training block (T1 to T2), trivial significant increases in body mass (p 5 0.016, Hedge’s g 5 0.04) and bench press 1RM (p 5 0.01, g 5 0.16) were observed, as well as small significant increases in back squat 1RM (p , 0.001, g 5 0.23), deadlift 1RM (p 5 0.003, g 5 0.20), powerlifting total (p , 0.001, g 5 0.21), and Wilks Score (p , 0.001, g 5 0.27). There were no significant differences between groups for isometric back squat performance, psychometric measures, and body composition after training cessation (T2–T3). However, small significant decreases in isometric bench press performance were observed after 5 days (p , 0.001, g 5 0.16), but not 3 days of training cessation. The results of this study suggest maximal lower-body strength can be preserved during 3 and 5 days of training cessation, but maximal upper-body strength is only preserved for 3 days after 4 weeks of strength training in athletes.},

	shorttitle = {The Effect of Nordic Hamstring Exercise Intervention Volume on Eccentric Strength and Muscle Architecture Adaptations},
	abstract = {Background  Although performance of the Nordic hamstring exercise ({NHE}) has been shown to elicit adaptations that may reduce hamstring strain injury ({HSI}) risk and occurrence, compliance in {NHE} interventions in professional soccer teams is low despite a high occurrence of {HSI} in soccer. A possible reason for low compliance is the high dosages prescribed within the recommended interventions. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of {NHE}-training volume on eccentric hamstring strength and biceps femoris fascicle length adaptations.
Methods  A literature search was conducted using the {SPORTDiscus}, Ovid, and {PubMed} databases. A total of 293 studies were identified prior to application of the following inclusion criteria: (1) a minimum of 4 weeks of {NHE} training was completed; (2) mean ± standard deviation ({SD}) pre- and post-intervention were provided for the measured variables to allow for secondary analysis; and (3) biceps femoris muscle architecture was measured, which resulted in 13 studies identified for further analysis. The {TESTEX} criteria were used to assess the quality of studies with risk of bias assessment assessed using a fail-safe N (Rosenthal method). Consistency of studies was analysed using I2 as a test of heterogeneity and secondary analysis of studies included Hedges’ g effect sizes for strength and muscle architecture variables to provide comparison within studies, between-study differences were estimated using a random-effects model.
Results  A range of scores (3–11 out of 15) from the {TESTEX} criteria were reported, showing variation in study quality. A ‘low risk of bias’ was observed in the randomized controlled trials included, with no study bias shown for both strength or architecture (N = 250 and 663, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001). Study consistency was moderate to high for strength (I2 = 62.49\%) and muscle architecture (I2 = 88.03\%). Within-study differences showed that following interventions of ≥ 6 weeks, very large positive effect sizes were seen in eccentric strength following both high volume (g = 2.12) and low volume (g = 2.28) {NHE} interventions. Similar results were reported for changes in fascicle length (g ≥ 2.58) and a large-to-very large positive reduction in pennation angle (g ≥ 1.31). Between-study differences were estimated to be at a magnitude of 0.374 (p = 0.009) for strength and 0.793 (p {\textless} 0.001) for architecture.
Conclusions  Reducing {NHE} volume prescription does not negatively affect adaptations in eccentric strength and muscle architecture when compared with high dose interventions. These findings suggest that lower volumes of {NHE} may be more appropriate for athletes, with an aim to increase intervention compliance, potentially reducing the risk of {HSI}.},

	abstract = {The biochemical regulation of energy metabolism ({EM}) allows cells to modulate their energetic output depending on available substrates and requirements. To this end, numerous biomolecular mechanisms exist that allow the sensing of the energetic state and corresponding adjustment of enzymatic reaction rates. This regulation is known to induce dynamic systems properties such as oscillations or perfect adaptation. Although the various mechanisms of energy regulation have been studied in detail from many angles at the experimental and theoretical levels, no framework is available for the systematic analysis of {EM} from a control systems perspective. In this study, we have used principles well known in control to clarify the basic system features that govern {EM}. The major result is a subdivision of the biomolecular mechanisms of energy regulation in terms of widely used engineering control mechanisms: proportional, integral, derivative control, and structures: feedback, cascade and feed-forward control. Evidence for each mechanism and structure is demonstrated and the implications for systems properties are shown through simulations. As the equivalence between biological systems and control components presented here is generic, it is also hypothesized that our work could eventually have an applicability that is much wider than the focus of the current study.},

The athletes were interviewed about their tapering practices using a semi-structured interview after which the audio content was transcribed.

The ﬁnal week included a reduction in training frequency by 47.9 6 17.5\% with the last training session performed 3 6 1 days before the competition. The participants typically stated that the main reasons for conducting the taper were maintaining strength and reducing the amount of fatigue. They also stated that (a) the taper was structured identically for the squat, bench press, and the deadlift; (b) the training during the taper was highly speciﬁc, the assistance exercises were removed, and the same equipment was used as during competition; (c) the source of information for tapering was their coach, and training ﬂuctuated based on the coach’s feedback; and (d) nutrition, foam rolling, static stretching, and massage were all given extra attention during the taper. These results may aid athletes and coaches in strength sports in terms of the optimization of tapering variables.},

J Strength Cond Res 32(1): 201–204, 2018—Currently, the sport of powerlifting discriminates against bench press scores and uses an empirical equation which is very difﬁcult to update to determine the best lifter within sex. The purpose of this study was to provide a simple and statistically sound method for evaluating powerlifting performance which could also be used with other multievent sports. Data were collected from a large public database on the top 50 (men) or the top 30 (women) individual raw competition scores in each weight class for each of the 3 powerlifting lifts. Mean and {SDs} were then calculated for each lift and weight class by sex. Powerlifting performance was evaluated by the sum of the 3 z-scores for the 3 lifts divided by 3 (the highest score wins). The z-scores reﬂect a dimensionless number which can be used to evaluate each lift and the total of the 3 lifts across weight classes and between sexes. Although the mean and {SDs} should be relatively stable, this computation is transparent and can be readily updated as lifters improve. This system overcomes the bias against bench press and many of the measurement challenges in evaluating athletes in multievent sports, in multiple weight divisions, and between sexes. These ﬁndings can beneﬁt coaches and athletes by allowing simpler evaluations of performance and improvement.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle contractile function declines with aging, disease, and disuse. In vivo muscle contractile function depends on a variety of factors, but force, contractile velocity and power generating capacity ultimately derive from the summed contribution of single muscle ﬁbers. The contractile performance of these ﬁbers are, in turn, dependent upon the isoform and function of myoﬁlament proteins they express, with myosin protein expression and its mechanical and kinetic characteristics playing a predominant role. Alterations in myoﬁlament protein biology, therefore, may contribute to the development of functional limitations and disability in these conditions. Recent studies suggest that these conditions are associated with altered single ﬁber performance due to decreased expression of myoﬁlament proteins and/or changes in myosin-actin cross-bridge interactions. Furthermore, cellular and myoﬁlament-level adaptations are related to diminished whole muscle and whole body performance. Notably, the effect of these various conditions on myoﬁlament and single ﬁber function tends to be larger in older women compared to older men, which may partially contribute to their higher rates of disability. To maintain functionality and provide the most appropriate and effective countermeasures to aging, disease, and disuse in both sexes, a more thorough understanding is needed of the contribution of myoﬁlament adaptations to functional disability in older men and women and their contribution to tissue level function and mobility impairment.},

	abstract = {While force-velocity-power characteristics of resistance exercises, such as bench presses and squats, have been well documented, little attention has been paid to load, force, and power-velocity relationships in exercises engaging core muscles. Given that power produced during lifting tasks or trunk rotations plays an important role in most sport-speciﬁc and daily life activities, its measurement should represent an important part of the test battery in both athletes and the general population. The aim of this scoping review was 1) to map the literature related to testing methods assessing core muscle strength and stability in sport and rehabilitation, chieﬂy studies with particular focus on force-velocity-power characteristics of exercises involving the use of core muscles, 2) and to identify gaps in existing studies and suggest further research in this ﬁeld. The literature search was conducted on Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, Web of Science, {PubMed} and {MEDLINE}, which was completed by {SpringerLink}, Google Scholar and Elsevier. The inclusion criteria were met in 37 articles. Results revealed that among a variety of studies investigating the core stability and core strength in sport and rehabilitation, only few of them analyzed force–velocity–power characteristics of exercises involving the use of core muscles. Most of them evaluated maximal isometric strength of the core and its endurance. However, there are some studies that assessed muscle power during lifting tasks at different loads performed either with free weights or using the Smith machine. Similarly, power and velocity were assessed during trunk rotations performed with different weights when standing or sitting. Nevertheless, there is still scant research investigating the power-velocity and force-velocity relationship during exercises engaging core muscles in able-bodied and para athletes with different demands on stability and strength of the core. Therefore, more research is needed to address this gap in the literature and aim research at assessing strength and power-related measures within cross-sectional and intervention studies. A better understanding of the power-force-velocity proﬁles during exercises with high demands on the core musculature has implications for designing sport training and rehabilitation programs for enhancement of athletes’ performance and/or decrease their risk of back pain.},

In humans, skeletal muscle comprises approximately 40 \% of total body weight and contains 50–75 \% of all body proteins. In general, muscle mass depends on the balance between protein synthesis and degradation and both processes are sensitive to factors such as nutritional status, hormonal balance, physical activity/exercise, and injury or disease, among others. In this review, we discuss the various domains of muscle structure and function including its cytoskeletal architecture, excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, and force and power generation. We will limit the discussion to human skeletal muscle and emphasize recent scientiﬁc literature on single muscle ﬁbers.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Serial sarcomere number determines a muscle’s length during maximum force production and its available length range for active force generation. Skeletal muscle length adapts to functional demands; for example, animal studies demonstrate that chronically shortened muscles decrease length by losing serial sarcomeres. This phenomenon has never been demonstrated in humans. Integrating multiscale imaging techniques, including two-photon microendoscopy, an innovative advance from traditional invasive measurement methods at the sarcomere scale, we establish that chronic impairments that place a muscle in a shortened position are associated with the loss of serial sarcomeres in humans. Understanding how muscle adapts following impairment is critical to the design of more effective clinical interventions to mitigate such adaptations and to improve function following motor impairments.
          , 
            
              A muscle’s structure, or architecture, is indicative of its function and is plastic; changes in input to or use of the muscle alter its architecture. Stroke-induced neural deficits substantially alter both input to and usage of individual muscles. We combined in vivo imaging methods (second-harmonic generation microendoscopy, extended field-of-view ultrasound, and fat-suppression {MRI}) to quantify functionally meaningful architecture parameters in the biceps brachii of both limbs of individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke and in age-matched, unimpaired controls. Specifically, serial sarcomere number ({SSN}) and physiological cross-sectional area ({PCSA}) were calculated from data collected at three anatomical scales: sarcomere length, fascicle length, and muscle volume. The interlimb differences in {SSN} and {PCSA} were significantly larger for stroke participants than for participants without stroke (
              P
              = 0.0126 and
              P
              = 0.0042, respectively), suggesting we observed muscle adaptations associated with stroke rather than natural interlimb variability. The paretic biceps brachii had ∼8,200 fewer serial sarcomeres and ∼2 cm
              2
              smaller {PCSA} on average than the contralateral limb (both
              P
              {\textless} 0.0001). This was manifested by substantially smaller muscle volumes (112 versus 163 cm
              3
              ), significantly shorter fascicles (11.0 versus 14.0 cm;
              P
              {\textless} 0.0001), and comparable sarcomere lengths (3.55 versus 3.59 μm;
              P
              = 0.6151) between limbs. Most notably, this study provides direct evidence of the loss of serial sarcomeres in human muscle observed in a population with neural impairments that lead to disuse and chronically place the affected muscle at a shortened position. This adaptation is consistent with functional consequences (increased passive resistance to elbow extension) that would amplify already problematic, neurally driven motor impairments.},

We administered vehicle or tamoxifen to adult Pax7-{DTA} mice and subjected them to progressive weighted wheel running ({PoWeR}). We then performed immunohistochemical analysis and whole-muscle {RNA}-seq of vehicle ({SCþ}) and tamoxifen-treated ({SCÀ}) mice. Further, we performed single myonuclear {RNA}-seq to provide detailed information on how satellite cell fusion affects myonuclear transcription.

We review cellular and molecular processes involved in injury and repair of skeletal muscle with regard to the amount and location of damage produced. Discussion is based on advances made by use of newer techniques, including immunochemistry, in situ hybridization, molecular biology, ultrastructural analysis, and cell culture. Damage and repair processes after eccentric work, stretch, overload, chronic stimulation, cold injury, and other models are discussed for cellular and molecular components. Hypertrophy or hyperplasia can occur under certain conditions. After injury, satellite cells are activated by growth factors. These cells can also be activated during fiber-type transformation, probably to provide necessary {DNA} content rather than to supply cells of a new lineage. Emphasis is given to myosin {mRNA} studied by in situ hybridization to localize subcellular distribution. Increases in {mRNA} concentration are found near nuclei in damaged regions and at the subcellular sites being repaired in the middle of skeletal muscle fibers or near the myotendon junction. The activation of genes for muscle regulatory factors during development is compared with their activation in regeneration and response to injury.

Twenty experienced resistance-trained men (age 5 25.5 6 3.2 years; body mass 5 86.9 6 12.4 kg; body height 5 178.0 6 5.3 cm) were tested for deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1RM), countermovement jump ({CMJ}), peak force ({PF}), and rate of force development ({pRFD}20) produced at isometric {MTP} and isometric {MSP}. Subjects were also assessed for architecture of vastus lateralis ({VL}). Physiological muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length ({FL}) were measured. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationships between variables. In addition, differences between {MTP} and {MSP} were assessed using paired-sample t-tests. A significant (p , 0.05) difference was detected on the correlation between deadlift 1RM and {MSP} (r 5 0.78; p , 0.001) compared with {MTP} (r 5 0.55; p 5 0.012). Moderate correlations were observed between {MSP} {PF} and {VLFL} (r 5 0.55; p 5 0.011). Midshin pull {pRFD}20 was the only parameter significantly correlated with {CMJ} (r 5 0.50; p 5 0.048). Significantly higher {PF} and {pRFD}20 were recorded in {MTP} compared with {MSP} (p 5 0.007 and p 5 0.003, respectively). The present results show that force produced from the floor position may be more important than force produced from a position that mimics the second pull of the clean for deadlift and vertical jump performances.

In response to exercise, signaling to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ({PPAR})-c coactivator-1a ({PGC}-1a) and other regulators ultimately produces an abundance of high-quality mitochondria, leading to reduced mitophagy and a higher mitochondrial content. This is accompanied by the presence of an enhanced protein quality control system that consists of the protein import machinery as well chaperones and proteases termed the mitochondrial unfolded protein response ({UPRmt}). The {UPRmt} monitors intraorganelle proteostasis, and strives to maintain a mito-nuclear balance between nuclear- and {mtDNA}-derived gene products via retrograde signaling from the organelle to the nucleus. In addition, antioxidant capacity is improved, affording greater protection against oxidative stress. In contrast, chronic disuse conditions produce similar signaling but result in decrements in mitochondrial quality and content. Thus, the interactive cross talk of the regulatory networks that control organelle turnover during wide variations in muscle use and disuse remain incompletely understood, despite our improving knowledge of the traditional regulators of organelle content and function. This brief review acknowledges existing regulatory networks and summarizes recent discoveries of novel biological pathways involved in determining organelle biogenesis, dynamics, mitophagy, protein quality control, and antioxidant capacity, identifying ample protein targets for therapeutic intervention that determine muscle and mitochondrial health.},

	title = {Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Plasticity by the Gut Microbiome},
	url = {https://uknowledge.uky.edu/physiology_etds/57/},
	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome could play a role in skeletal muscle plasticity, providing novel treatments for muscle wasting diseases and/or performance enhancements. I first sought to determine if the gut microbiome is necessary for skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise. Forty-two, four-month old, female C57Bl/6J underwent nine weeks of weighted wheel running or remained in cage with a locked wheel, without or without the administration of antibiotics (treated). In response to wheel running, I found that antibiotic depletion of the microbiome led to a blunted hypertrophic response in the soleus muscle as measured by normalized muscle wet weight and mean and fiber-type specific cross-sectional area ({CSA}). The plantaris muscle of mice who ran with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis showed a blunted glycolytic to oxidative fiber-type shift, decreased myonuclear accretion and satellite cell abundance compared to non-treated runners. These results are the first to demonstrate that an intact microbiome is necessary for skeletal muscle adaption to exercise.

I next tested if the gut microbiome mitigates skeletal muscle atrophy induced by hind limb immobilization. Eighteen, four-month old, female C57Bl/6J mice were divided into two groups (n=9/group), that received cecal microbial transfers from either exercise-trained or sedentary donors. After four weeks of cecal transplants, the recipient mice underwent 10-days of single leg hind-limb immobilization. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the recipients of the exercise-trained donors experienced significantly less skeletal muscle atrophy of the soleus muscle, as measures by mean fiber and fiber-type specific {CSA}. The transfer of microbiome from exercise-trained donors also led to a preservation of Type-2A fibers in the immobilized soleus muscle. These results demonstrated that the transfer of a microbiome from an exercise-trained host into recipients mitigated skeletal muscle atrophy, in addition to the persevering Type-2A fibers abundance during atrophy

To better understand how the gut microbiome acts to modulate skeletal muscle mass and fiber-type composition, metagenomic sequencing was performed on donor and recipient of exercise-trained and sedentary cecal content. Sequencing data revealed significant differences in the microbiome between the two recipient groups. Further microbial functional comparisons were made and distinguished significant associations in fucose degradation and histidine metabolism in the recipients who received microbiome from exercised-trained donors. To further interrogate the metagenomic sequencing, microbial sequence features were analyzed with {MelonnPan} to determine predictive metabolites associated with each recipient group. Lipids and bile acids metabolites were significantly associated with the recipients of the exercise-trained donors. There was a trend for imidazole propionate to be associated with the recipients of the exercise-trained donors. The metagenomic analysis indicated the microbiome from an exercise-trained host was associated with metabolic pathways that generate short chain fatty acids (fucose degradation) and the histidine-derived metabolite imidazole propionate.

The results from this dissertation provide evidence of crosstalk between skeletal muscle and the gut microbiome, providing for the first-time data that demonstrates the gut microbiome influences both anabolic and catabolic signaling in skeletal muscle. Although a direct mechanism for the skeletal muscle-gut microbiome interaction was not found, the metabolites propionate and imidazole propionate were identified as possible candidate for future studies. A general conclusion from the two studies described in this dissertation provides new evidence for the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and fiber-type composition.

Future work will need to focus on the identification of the gut microbial-derived metabolites promote anabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Additional studies should also determine if the attenuation in atrophy induced by hind limb immobilization is conserved in other models of atrophy as observed with skeletal muscle wasting diseases and space exploration.},

              regulation of contraction in vertebrate striated muscle is exerted primarily through effects on the thin filament, which regulate strong cross-bridge binding to actin. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the position of tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn) on the thin filament determines the interaction of myosin with the binding sites on actin. These binding sites can be characterized as blocked (unable to bind to cross bridges), closed (able to weakly bind cross bridges), or open (able to bind cross bridges so that they subsequently isomerize to become strongly bound and release {ATP} hydrolysis products). Flexibility of the Tm may allow variability in actin (A) affinity for myosin along the thin filament other than through a single 7 actin:1 tropomyosin:1 troponin (A
              7
              {TmTn}) regulatory unit. Tm position on the actin filament is regulated by the occupancy of {NH}-terminal Ca

              binding sites on {TnC}, conformational changes resulting from Ca
              2+
              binding, and changes in the interactions among Tn, Tm, and actin and as well as by strong S1 binding to actin. Ca
              2+
              binding to {TnC} enhances {TnC}-{TnI} interaction, weakens {TnI} attachment to its binding sites on 1–2 actins of the regulatory unit, increases Tm movement over the actin surface, and exposes myosin-binding sites on actin previously blocked by Tm. Adjacent Tm are coupled in their overlap regions where Tm movement is also controlled by interactions with {TnT}. {TnT} also interacts with {TnC}-{TnI} in a Ca
              2+
              -dependent manner. All these interactions may vary with the different protein isoforms. The movement of Tm over the actin surface increases the “open” probability of myosin binding sites on actins so that some are in the open configuration available for myosin binding and cross-bridge isomerization to strong binding, force-producing states. In skeletal muscle, strong binding of cycling cross bridges promotes additional Tm movement. This movement effectively stabilizes Tm in the open position and allows cooperative activation of additional actins in that and possibly neighboring A
              7
              {TmTn} regulatory units. The structural and biochemical findings support the physiological observations of steady-state and transient mechanical behavior. Physiological studies suggest the following. 1) Ca
              2+
              binding to Tn/Tm exposes sites on actin to which myosin can bind. 2) Ca
              2+
              regulates the strong binding of M·{ADP}·P
              i
              to actin, which precedes the production of force (and/or shortening) and release of hydrolysis products. 3) The initial rate of force development depends mostly on the extent of Ca
              2+
              activation of the thin filament and myosin kinetic properties but depends little on the initial force level. 4) A small number of strongly attached cross bridges within an A
              7
              {TmTn} regulatory unit can activate the actins in one unit and perhaps those in neighboring units. This results in additional myosin binding and isomerization to strongly bound states and force production. 5) The rates of the product release steps per se (as indicated by the unloaded shortening velocity) early in shortening are largely independent of the extent of thin filament activation ([Ca
              2+
              ]) beyond a given baseline level. However, with a greater extent of shortening, the rates depend on the activation level. 6) The cooperativity between neighboring regulatory units contributes to the activation by strong cross bridges of steady-state force but does not affect the rate of force development. 7) Strongly attached, cycling cross bridges can delay relaxation in skeletal muscle in a cooperative manner. 8) Strongly attached and cycling cross bridges can enhance Ca
              2+
              binding to cardiac {TnC}, but influence skeletal {TnC} to a lesser extent. 9) Different Tn subunit isoforms can modulate the cross-bridge detachment rate as shown by studies with mutant regulatory proteins in myotubes and in in vitro motility assays. These results and conclusions suggest possible explanations for differences between skeletal and cardiac muscle regulation and delineate the paths future research may take toward a better understanding of striated muscle regulation.},

	abstract = {Studies in rodent muscle suggest that autophagy is regulated by acute exercise, exercise training and insulin stimulation. However, little is known about the regulation of autophagy in human skeletal muscle. Here we investigate the autophagic response to acute one-legged exercise, one-legged exercise training and subsequent insulin stimulation in exercised and non-exercised human muscle. Acute one-legged exercise decreased (P{\textless}0.01) lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 ({LC}3) (ß50\%) and the {LC}3-{II}/{LC}3-I ratio (ß60\%) indicating that content of autophagosomes decreases with exercise in human muscle. The decrease in {LC}3-{II}/{LC}3-I ratio did not correlate with activation of 5 {AMP} activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) trimer complexes in human muscle. Consistently, pharmacological {AMPK} activation with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside ({AICAR}) in mouse muscle did not affect the {LC}3-{II}/{LC}3-I ratio. Four hours after exercise, insulin further reduced (P{\textless}0.01) the {LC}3-{II}/{LC}3-I ratio (ß80\%) in muscle of the exercised and non-exercised leg in humans. This coincided with increased Ser-757 phosphorylation of Unc51 like kinase 1 ({ULK}1), which is suggested as a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ({mTORC}1) target. Accordingly, inhibition of {mTOR} signalling in mouse muscle prevented the ability of insulin to reduce the {LC}3-{II}/{LC}3-I ratio. In response to 3 weeks of one-legged exercise training, the {LC}3-{II}/{LC}3-I ratio decreased (P{\textless}0.05) in both trained and untrained muscle and this change was largely driven by an increase in {LC}3-I content. Taken together, acute exercise and insulin stimulation reduce muscle autophagosome content, while exercise training may increase the capacity for formation of autophagosomes in muscle. Moreover, {AMPK} activation during exercise may not be sufﬁcient to regulate autophagy in muscle, while {mTORC}1 signalling via {ULK}1 probably mediates the autophagy-inhibiting effect of insulin.},

            Electromyostimulation ({EMS}) incorporates the use of electrical current to activate skeletal muscle and facilitate contraction. It is commonly used in clinical settings to mimic voluntary contractions and enhance the rehabilitation of human skeletal muscles. Although the beneficial effects of {EMS} are widely accepted, discrepancies concerning the specific responses to {EMS} versus voluntary actions exist. The unique effects of {EMS} have been attributed to several mechanisms, most notably a reversal of the recruitment pattern typically associated with voluntary muscle activation. This perspective outlines the authors' contention that electrical stimulation recruits motor units in a nonselective, spatially fixed, and temporally synchronous pattern. Furthermore, it synthesizes the evidence that supports the contention that this recruitment pattern contributes to increased muscle fatigue when compared with voluntary actions. The authors believe the majority of evidence suggests that {EMS}-induced motor unit recruitment is nonselective and that muscle fibers are recruited without obvious sequencing related to fiber types.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1560–1567, 2022—This experiment examined changes to the rate of force development ({RFD}) expressed under loaded jump conditions between individuals with a higher (stronger) and lower (weaker) weightlifting performance (as assessed by the 1 repetition maximum [{RM}] power clean) after training with the weightlifting derivatives. Two groups of markedly different weightlifting ability undertook 10 weeks of training with the power clean variants, snatch pulls, and jump squats across heavy and light conditions. Testing was performed at baseline, after 5 weeks of training (midtest) and after training (post-test). During testing, {RFD} was assessed under a series of loads (20–80\% squat 1RM) through the jump squat. Furthermore, the force-velocity relationship, and unloaded jump strategy (through the force-time curve waveform), were also examined. Very large change (Hedge’s g, 95\% confidence interval [g] 5 2.10, 1.24 to 4.16) in {RFD} at 20\% 1RM at mid-test occurred within the stronger group. Conversely, a small increase (g 5 0.27, 0.53–1.91) among the weaker subjects existed in this measure at mid-test, reaching a moderate increase at post-test (g 5 0.71, 20.18 to 2.15). Limited improvements were seen by the stronger subjects in {RFD} at 60 and 80\% 1RM at either mid-test (60\%: g 5 0.27, 20.75 to 1.33; 80\% 5 0.02, 21.01 to 1.00) or post-test (60\%: g 5 0.52, 20.38 to 1.80; 80\% 5 20.26, 21.23 to 0.77). The stronger group experienced a shift throughout the force-velocity relationship while a more force-dominant adaptation occurred in weaker subjects. Differences in jump strategy between groups were also noted. Such training will elicit practically different adaptations in rapid force production depending on the individual’s baseline weightlifting ability.},

Passive glenohumeral ({GH}) extension, internal rotation, and external rotation {ROM} were signiﬁcantly decreased in powerlifters (p , 0.050). Powerlifters displayed decreased {ROM} in the Apley scratch test in both dominant (p = 0.015) and nondominant (p = 0.025) arms. However, knee extension angle was markedly improved in powerlifters (20.3 6 7.38) compared with controls (29.9 6 6.28; p , 0.001).

A physiologic parameter termed pulse transit time ({PTT}) has been studied intensively to be used as an indirect marker of such pathologic conditions. It is deﬁned as the time it takes a pressure pulsation to travel between two arterial sites. For convenience of measurement, the interval between the peak of the R-wave on the electrocardiogram and the onset of the corresponding pulse in the ﬁnger pad measured by photoplethysmography is usually used. In this review, its deﬁnition, current applications in cardiovascular related studies and issues are presented in turn. Investigational studies suggest that {PTT} did not meet the level of accuracy required for medical practice as a marker for beat-to-beat blood pressure ({BP}). However, documented evidences indicate that {PTT} has high correlations when it is utilised as a surrogate semi-quantitative monitor of abrupt {BP} changes. Present literature suggests that description of disease-speciﬁc cardiovascular reactivity pattern is possible with techniques based on {PTT}. The attraction of {PTT} due to its non-invasive nature and revealing properties can only increase.

	abstract = {The brain is the key organ of the response to stress because it determines what is threatening and, therefore, potentially stressful, as well as the physiological and behavioral responses which can be either adaptive or damaging. Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the “flight-or-fight” response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body (“allostatic load”). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation (“allostasis”). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.},

	title = {Physics of muscle contraction},
	abstract = {In this paper we report, clarify and broaden various recent efforts to complement the chemistry-centered models of force generation in (skeletal) muscles by mechanics-centered models. The physical mechanisms of interest can be grouped into two classes: passive and active. The main passive effect is the fast force recovery which does not require the detachment of myosin cross-bridges from actin filaments and can operate without a specialized supply of metabolic fuel ({ATP}). In mechanical terms, it can be viewed as a collective folding-unfolding phenomenon in the system of interacting bi-stable units and modeled by near equilibrium Langevin dynamics. The parallel active force generation mechanism operates at slow time scales, requires detachment and is crucially dependent on {ATP} hydrolysis. The underlying mechanical processes take place far from equilibrium and are represented by stochastic models with broken time reversal symmetry implying non-potentiality, correlated noise or multiple reservoirs. The modeling approaches reviewed in this paper deal with both active and passive processes and support from the mechanical perspective the biological point of view that phenomena involved in slow (active) and fast (passive) force generation are tightly intertwined. They reveal, however, that biochemical studies in solution, macroscopic physiological measurements and structural analysis do not provide by themselves all the necessary insights into the functioning of the organized contractile system. In particular, the reviewed body of work emphasizes the important role of long-range interactions and criticality in securing the targeted mechanical response in the physiological regime of isometric contractions. The importance of the purely mechanical micro-scale modeling is accentuated at the end of the paper where we address the puzzling issue of the stability of muscle response on the so called “descending limb” of the isometric tetanus.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1681.2005.04143.x},
	abstract = {{SUMMARY} 1. The development of microneurography, in which an insulated tungsten microelectrode is inserted into an accessible peripheral or cranial nerve in awake human subjects, has allowed detailed analyses of the signalling capacities of single mechanoreceptive afferents from the skin, muscles and joints. For example, we know much about how the two classes of rapidly adapting (Meissner and Pacinian) and two classes of slowly adapting (Merkel and Ruffini) cutaneous mechanoreceptors encode forces applied normal or tangential to the skin of the hand and the similarities and differences in glabrous versus non-glabrous skin (and receptors associated with hairs). We also know about stretch- and force-sensitive endings in muscle (the muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ, respectively) and how they behave during passive or active movements or during isometric contractions. In addition, we have characterized the firing properties of mechanoreceptors in the joint capsules of the fingers. However, we know little about sensory nerves in the periosteum, other than that nociceptors and Pacinian corpuscles exist. 2. In addition to studies on the physiology of sensory endings in human subjects, microstimulation through the recording microelectrode has revealed how the brain deals with the sensory information conveyed by a single afferent. From this work, we know that there is specificity in the sensory channels: electrical stimulation of a single Meissner or Pacinian corpuscle generates frequency dependent illusions of ‘flutter’ or ‘vibration’, whereas microstimulation of a single Merkel afferent can produce a percept of ‘pressure’ and stimulation of a single joint afferent can evoke a sensation of ‘joint rotation’. Interestingly, the input from a single Ruffini ending in the skin cannot be perceived and the same is true of muscle spindle afferents. So, where does this leave us with osseoperception from the mouth? Given that the periodontal receptors in the vicinity have been lost, which mechanoreceptive endings could encode forces applied to a bone-implanted prosthesis? 3. Meissner and Merkel endings have very small receptive fields and respond only to local forces. Pacinian corpuscles have an exquisite sensitivity to brisk mechanical events and could respond to such stimuli transmitted through the bone to a remote receptor, but would not be able to encode sustained forces. Ruffini endings also respond to forces applied remote to the receptive field and, unlike the Pacinian corpuscles, respond in a sustained fashion, but would their signals be perceived? Like muscle spindles, it is possible that the coactivation of many Ruffini endings could provide meaningful information. Finally, as we have seen, the input from a single joint receptor can be perceived, but they mostly respond at the limits of joint rotation, so it is unlikely that any associated with the temporomandibular joint could contribute to osseoperception.},

            The American Physical Therapy Association ({APTA}), in conjunction with the Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Section of {APTA}, have commissioned the development of this clinical practice guideline to assist physical therapists in their clinical decision making when managing patients with heart failure. Physical therapists treat patients with varying degrees of impairments and limitations in activity and participation associated with heart failure pathology across the continuum of care. This document will guide physical therapist practice in the examination and treatment of patients with a known diagnosis of heart failure. The development of this clinical practice guideline followed a structured process and resulted in 9 key action statements to guide physical therapist practice. The level and quality of available evidence were graded based on specific criteria to determine the strength of each action statement. Clinical algorithms were developed to guide the physical therapist in appropriate clinical decision making. Physical therapists are encouraged to work collaboratively with other members of the health care team in implementing these action statements to improve the activity, participation, and quality of life in individuals with heart failure and reduce the incidence of heart failure-related re-admissions.},

	abstract = {The transcriptional demands of skeletal muscle fibres are high and require hundreds of nuclei (myonuclei) to produce specialised contractile machinery and multiple mitochondria along their length. Each myonucleus spatially regulates gene expression in a finite volume of cytoplasm, termed the myonuclear domain ({MND}), which positively correlates with fibre cross‐sectional area ({CSA}). Endurance training triggers adaptive responses in skeletal muscle, including myonuclear accretion, decreased {MND} sizes and increased expression of the transcription co‐activator peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ coactivator‐1α ({PGC}‐1α). Previous work has shown that overexpression of {PGC}‐1α in skeletal muscle regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, myonuclear accretion and {MND} volume. However, whether {PGC}‐1α is critical for these processes in adaptation to endurance training remained unclear. To test this, we evaluated myonuclear distribution and organisation in endurance‐trained wild‐type mice and mice lacking {PGC}‐1α in skeletal muscle ({PGC}1α {mKO}). Here, we show a differential myonuclear accretion response to endurance training that is governed by {PGC}‐1α and is dependent on muscle fibre size. The positive relationship of {MND} size and muscle fibre {CSA} trended towards a stronger correlation in {PGC}‐1a {mKO} versus control after endurance training, suggesting that myonuclear accretion was slightly affected with increasing fibre {CSA} in {PGC}‐1α {mKO}. However, in larger fibres, the relationship between {MND} and {CSA} was significantly altered in trained versus sedentary {PGC}‐1α {mKO}, suggesting that {PGC}‐1α is critical for myonuclear accretion in these fibres. Accordingly, there was a negative correlation between the nuclear number and {CSA}, suggesting that in larger fibres myonuclear numbers fail to scale with {CSA}. Our findings suggest that {PGC}‐1α is an important contributor to myonuclear accretion following moderate‐intensity endurance training. This may contribute to the adaptive response to endurance training by enabling a sufficient rate of transcription of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(4): 1003–1010, 2022—The purpose of this study is: (a) provide normative performance and anthropometric data of Southern European classic powerlifters of both sexes; (b) determine the possible relationships between these variables and performance; and (c) develop population-specific predictive equations for single lifts and overall powerlifting performance. During an unofficial national-level competition, we recruited 74 athletes (51 men and 23 women) and recorded their individual, anthropometric, and performance characteristics and divided them into sex and 2 performance categories based on their Wilks points. Weaker (,370 Wilks points) and stronger (.370 Wilks points) athletes of both sexes were compared by two-way analysis of variance. Simple correlation and multiple linear regression between individual/anthropometric characteristics and performance were modeled. We applied a step-forward multiple linear regression model to predict single lifts and overall performance. All parameters significantly differed between sexes (p , 0.05 for all comparisons). Stronger male athletes had a significantly larger neck (42 6 2.8 cm; effect size [{ES}] 5 0.59), and flexed (40.6 6 3.3 cm; {ES} 5 1.18) and relaxed upper-arm (37.5 6 3.1 cm; {ES} 5 1.34) and thigh girths (63.6 6 7.0 cm; {ES} 5 0.77) compared to weaker male athletes. Furthermore, stronger women had significantly larger flexed (32.6 6 3.3 cm; {ES} 5 0.88) and relaxed upper-arm (33 6 1.5 cm; {ES} 5 2.28) and chest girths (99.3 6 9.2 cm; {ES} 5 1.10) compared to weaker female athletes. A combination of experience, fat mass, and upper-limb and lower-limb muscle mass indexes can accurately and precisely predict overall and individual lift performance (r2 \$ 0.83 for all the predictions). This is the first study to provide normative performance and anthropometric data in Southern European male and female powerlifters.},

The final, short distance ({\textless} 50 µm) from capillary to the most distant mitochondria, in skeletal muscle where exercising ­O2 demands may increase 100-fold, challenges our understanding of ­O2 transport. To power cellular energetics ­O2 reaches its muscle mitochondrial target by dissociating from hemoglobin, crossing the red cell membrane, plasma, endothelial surface layer, endothelial cell, interstitial space, myocyte sarcolemma and a variable expanse of cytoplasm before traversing the mitochondrial outer/inner membranes and reacting with reduced cytochrome c and protons. This past century our understanding of ­O2’s passage across the body’s final O­ 2 frontier has been completely revised. This review considers the latest structural and functional data, challenging the following entrenched notions: (1) That ­O2 moves freely across blood cell membranes. (2) The Krogh–Erlang model whereby O­ 2 pressure decreases systematically from capillary to mitochondria. (3) Whether intramyocyte diffusion distances matter. (4) That mitochondria are separate organelles rather than coordinated and highly plastic syncytia. (5) The roles of free versus myoglobin-facilitated ­O2 diffusion. (6) That myocytes develop anoxic loci. These questions, and the intriguing notions that (1) cellular membranes, including interconnected mitochondrial membranes, act as low resistance conduits for ­O2, lipids and ­H+-electrochemical transport and (2) that myoglobin oxy/deoxygenation state controls mitochondrial oxidative function via nitric oxide, challenge established tenets of muscle metabolic control. These elements redefine muscle ­O2 transport models essential for the development of effective therapeutic countermeasures to pathological decrements in ­O2 supply and physical performance.},

	abstract = {Organismalperformance lies at the base of ecological and evolutionary processes, and the consequences of individual variation in performance have become afocus of physiological ecology. The study of the relations ofperformance to Darwinian fitness integrates the traditionally reductionist approach ofphysiological ecology with the perspectives ofgenetics and evolution. Four levels of biological organization have been included in this effort:the description ofgenetic variation, the analysis of biochemical andphysiological consequences of that variation, the description of variation in the capacity of individuals toperform various activities, and the analysis of the effect of that variation in performance capacity on individual variation in Darwinian fitness. Mechanisms within each of those levels have been elaborated, and cause-and-effect links have been established among the levels. Two approaches to defining causal links areprominent. Thegene-to-performance school begins with the observation ofgenetic variation (e.g., thepresence in a species of allelic isozymes with different responses to temperature) and seeks to trace theperformance ofdifferent genotypes upward through successive levels of biological organization, ultimately to variation in behavior and the relation of that variation to natural selection. Afew studies have been successful in this endeavor, largely because they were based on detailed information about the ecology of the species investigated. These studies have revealed stabilizing selection maintaining genetic polymorphisms. Physiological ecologists have approached the same questions as those addressed by geneticists, but thephysiologists have started with the description of individual variation in performance that is almost certainly under the control of multiple genetic loci. From thispoint they have moved outward in two directions. One line of investigation involves a reductionist analysis of the mechanistic basis of variation in performance, whereas the other seeks associations between performance and fitness. Substantialprogress has been made in the reductionist direction, although more information is needed about the heritabilities ofparticular characteristics. The upward direction has been less traveled, and the chances of success will be maximized by employing the same detailed ecologicalperspective that has been successfulfor gene-to-performance studies. The activities to be studied should be selected on the basis of their demonstrable importance to thefitness of individuals under natural conditions, and the behavioral ecology literature contains many examples of activities of that sort.},

Adult ({\textgreater}4 mo) {HSA}-{GFP} mice performed {PoWeR} for 8 wk then detrained for 12 wk; age-matched untrained mice were used to control for the long duration of the study.

Over-representation analysis of promoters revealed a larger number of hyper- versus hypo-methylated pathways in both nuclear populations after training and evidence for reciprocal regulation of methylation between nucleus types, with hypomethylation of promoter regions in Wnt signaling-related genes in myonuclei and hypermethylation in interstitial nuclei. After 12 wk of detraining, promoter {CpGs} in documented muscle remodeling-associated genes and pathways that were differentially methylated immediately after {PoWeR} were persistently differentially methylated in myonuclei, along with long-term promoter hypomethylation in interstitial nuclei. No enduring gene expression changes in muscle tissue were observed using {RNA}-sequencing. Upon 4 wk of retraining, mice that trained previously grew more at the whole muscle and fiber type-specific cellular level than training na¨ıve mice, with no difference in myonuclear number.

Here, we introduce {OpenSim} Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the {OpenSim} modeling and simulation package. {OpenSim} Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the issues with complexity by considering the possibility that the system design community has been struggling with the consequences of a ―big assumption‖ concerning our core definition of a system. According to Kegan and Lahey, ―big assumptions‖ represent tenets in people‘s ―mental construction‖ of the world that are viewed as accurate representations of the way things are and are ―uncritically taken as true.‖ However, when these assumptions are not true, they create a barrier to success by impeding the ability to adapt appropriately [(1)]. The intent of this chapter is to support an alternative treatment of complexity in system design by extracting our community‘s viewpoint—the mental construction we perceive the world through—such that we are able to look at it objectively. To do so, the chapter frames a normative comparative study intended to assess the ability of any design viewpoint to successfully facilitate system design. The evaluative criteria are the assurance of the design process and the correctness and completeness of the solution to resolve the need. The study compares the prevailing viewpoint derived from the ―big assumption‖ to a viewpoint built around an alternative view of systems. The results show that the prevailing viewpoint agreement with the evaluative criteria becomes increasingly unsatisfactory as systems exceed the capability and capacity of the practitioner to comprehend, and therefore brings into question the validity of the “big assumption”. The analysis further suggests that the systems community has been actively compensating for the insufficiency of its models, which can create a perception of complexity as significant to design. On the other hand, the alternative viewpoint demonstrates theoretical agreement with the evaluative criteria and shows the potential for systematic solution derivation, suggesting that the alternate definition of systems might form a more suitable basis for the design of “complex” systems. The seemingly insurmountable problems we experience with the burden of ―complexity‖ may have a path to resolution, but only if we choose to accept the implications that our struggles may be self-imposed.},

Neoprene knee sleeves of varying tightness augment barbell squat one repetition maximum performance without improving other indices of muscular strength, power, or endurance. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S6–S15, 2021—Neoprene knee sleeves are commonly used by powerlifters and recreational users but are heavily under-researched. Furthermore, no data exist on whether knee sleeves of varying compressive tightness impact muscular performance similar to commonly used knee wraps, which are both generally effective and more so when increasingly constrictive. Fifteen resistance trained, knee sleeve naive, recreational weight lifting men (22.1 6 4.1 years; 177.5 6 5.9 cm; 87.8 6 7.8 kg) visited the laboratory on 3 separate occasions one week apart, assigned in a randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced fashion to either a minimally supportive control sleeve ({CS}) condition, a manufacturer-recommended sizing neoprene knee sleeve (“normal” sleeve; {NS}), or a one size smaller (than {NS}) neoprene knee sleeve (tighter sleeve [{TS}]). On each visit, subjects sequentially completed vertical jump (countermovement and squat jumps for both peak and mean power), one repetition maximum (1RM) barbell squat, and {GymAware} assessments (peak power, peak velocity, and dip) at 90\% (reported) and 100\% (tested) 1RM as well as one-leg extension (1RM, repetitions to failure, and total volume load at 75\% 1RM) tests. All data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance at p , 0.05. Analysis revealed a significant condition effect on barbell squat 1RM (p 5 0.003; h2 5 0.339), whereby both {NS} (p 5 0.044; 166 6 24 kg) and {TS} (p 5 0.019; 166 6 21 kg) outperformed {CS} (161 6 22 kg), with no difference between neoprene sleeves. Conversely, no other tested parameters differed between knee sleeve conditions (p \$ 0.05). The present results demonstrate that neoprene knee sleeves may function independent of tightness, relative to recommended sizing and ultimately unlike knee wraps. Furthermore, the singular benefits observed on barbell squat maximal strength potentially suggests an exercise-specific benefit yet to be fully elucidated.},

Myosin heavy chain composition, creatine analogues, and the relationship of muscle creatine content and fast-twitch proportion to Wilks coefficient in powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 34(11): 3022–3030, 2020—Little data exist on powerlifting-specific skeletal muscle adaptations, and none elucidate sex differences in powerlifters. Powerlifters tend to display higher fast-twitch fiber content and phosphagen system dependence. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether fast-twitch fiber or muscle creatine content are predictive of competitive powerlifting performance (via Wilks coefficient). Twelve actively competing powerlifters ({PL}; n 5 6M/6F; age 5 21.3 6 1.0; 3.0 6 1.8 year competing; 7.3 6 6.6 meets attended) and 10 sedentary controls ({CON}; n 5 5M/5F; age 5 19.4 6 2.0 year) underwent vastus lateralis muscle biopsies and venipuncture to compare the myosin heavy chain ({MHC}) fiber type and creatine analogue profiles between groups of both sexes, and determine whether {MHC} {IIa} and muscle total creatine ({MTC}) composition predict powerlifting performance. Samples were analyzed for specific {MHC} isoform (I, {IIa}, and {IIx}) content via mixed homogenate {SDS}-{PAGE}, and creatine analogues ({MTC}, muscle creatine transporter [{SLC}6A8], serum total creatine [{STC}], and serum creatinine [{CRT}]). Furthermore, {MHC} {IIa} and {MTC} content were compared with Wilks coefficient using Pearson correlation coefficients. Male {PL} {MHC} content was 50 6 6\% I, 45 6 6\% {IIa}, and 5 6 11\% {IIx}, versus 46 6 6\% I, 53 6 6 {IIa}, and 0\% {IIx} in female {PL}. Conversely, male {CON} {MHC} content was 33 6 5\% I, 38 6 7\% {IIa}, and 30 6 8\% {IIx}, vs. 35 6 9\% I, 44 6 8\% {IIa}, and 21 6 17\% {IIx} in female {CON}. Muscle total creatine, {SLC}6A8, {STC}, and {CRT} did not significantly differ between groups nor sexes. Finally, neither {MHC} {IIa} content (r 5 20.288; p 5 0.364) nor {MTC} (r 5 0.488; p 5 0.108) significantly predicted Wilks coefficient, suggesting these characteristics alone do not determine powerlifting skill variation.},

Historically, the coupling between muscle and bone has been viewed in light of mechanotransduction, which dictates that the mechanical forces applied to muscle are transmitted to the skeleton to initiate bone formation. However, these organs also communicate through the endocrine system, orchestrated by a family of cytokines namely myokines (derived from myocytes) and osteokines (derived from bone cells). A third player in this biochemical crosstalk is adipose tissue and the secretion of adipokines (derived from adipocytes). In this review, we discuss the bidirectional effects of myokines and osteokines on muscle and bone metabolism, and the impact of adipokines on both of these secretory organs.},

            Physical activity decreases the risk of a network of diseases, and exercise may be prescribed as medicine for lifestyle-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. During the past couple of decades, it has been apparent that skeletal muscle works as an endocrine organ, which can produce and secrete hundreds of myokines that exert their effects in either autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manners. Recent advances show that skeletal muscle produces myokines in response to exercise, which allow for crosstalk between the muscle and other organs, including brain, adipose tissue, bone, liver, gut, pancreas, vascular bed, and skin, as well as communication within the muscle itself. Although only few myokines have been allocated to a specific function in humans, it has been identified that the biological roles of myokines include effects on, for example, cognition, lipid and glucose metabolism, browning of white fat, bone formation, endothelial cell function, hypertrophy, skin structure, and tumor growth. This suggests that myokines may be useful biomarkers for monitoring exercise prescription for people with, for example, cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative diseases.},

We then consider in some detail how insulin and exercise each modulate muscle perfusion at both the microvascular and whole tissue level. The central role of the vascular endothelial cell in modulating both perfusion and transendothelial insulin and nutrient transport is also reviewed. The relationship between muscle metabolic insulin resistance and the vascular action of insulin in muscle continues to indicate an important role for the microvasculature as a target for insulin action and that impairing insulin's microvascular action significantly affects body glucose metabolism.},

	shorttitle = {Muscle memory},
	abstract = {Background In the context of mass regulation, ‘muscle memory’ can be deﬁned as long‐lasting cellular adaptations to hypertrophic exercise training that persist during detraining‐induced atrophy and may facilitate future adaptation. The cellular basis of muscle memory is not clearly deﬁned but may be related to myonuclear number and/or epigenetic changes within muscle ﬁbres.
Methods Utilizing progressive weighted wheel running ({PoWeR}), a novel murine exercise training model, we explored myonuclear dynamics and skeletal muscle {miRNA} levels with training and detraining utilizing immunohistochemistry, single ﬁbre myonuclear analysis, and quantitative analysis of {miRNAs}. We also used a genetically inducible mouse model of ﬂuorescent myonuclear labelling to study myonuclear adaptations early during exercise.
Results In the soleus, oxidative type 2a ﬁbres were larger after 2 months of {PoWeR} (P = 0.02), but muscle ﬁbre size and myonuclear number did not return to untrained levels after 6 months of detraining. Soleus type 1 ﬁbres were not larger after {PoWeR} but had signiﬁcantly more myonuclei, as well as central nuclei (P {\textless} 0.0001), the latter from satellite cell‐derived or resident myonuclei, appearing early during training and remaining with detraining. In the gastrocnemius muscle, oxidative type 2a ﬁbres of the deep region were larger and contained more myonuclei after {PoWeR} (P {\textless} 0.003), both of which returned to untrained levels after detraining. In the gastrocnemius and plantaris, two muscles where myonuclear number was comparable with untrained levels after 6 months of detraining, myonuclei were signiﬁcantly elongated with detraining (P {\textless} 0.0001). In the gastrocnemius, {miR}‐1 was lower with training and remained lower after detraining (P {\textless} 0.002).
Conclusions This study found that (i) myonuclei gained during hypertrophy are lost with detraining across muscles, even in oxidative ﬁbres; (ii) complete reversal of muscle adaptations, including myonuclear number, to untrained levels occurs within 6 months in the plantaris and gastrocnemius; (iii) the murine soleus is resistant to detraining; (iv) myonuclear accretion occurs early with wheel running and can be uncoupled from muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy; (v) resident (non‐satellite cell‐derived) myonuclei can adopt a central location; (vi) myonuclei change shape with training and detraining; and (vii) {miR}‐1 levels may reﬂect a memory of previous adaptation that facilitates future growth.},

Muscle activity was measured from the soleus ({SOL}), medial gastrocnemius ({MG}) and lateral gastrocnemius ({LG}) using surface electromyography ({EMG}) and quantified using wavelet and principal component analysis. Muscle fascicle strain rates were quantified using ultrasonography, and the muscle–tendon unit lengths were calculated from the segmental kinematics. The {EMG} intensities showed that the body uses the {SOL} relatively more for the higher-force, lower-velocity contractions than the {MG} and {LG}. The {EMG} spectra showed a shift to higher frequencies at faster muscle fascicle strain rates for {MG}: these shifts were independent of the level of muscle activity, the locomotor load and the muscle fascicle strain. These results indicated that a selective recruitment of the faster motor units occurred within the {MG} muscle in response to the increasing muscle fascicle strain rates. This preferential recruitment of the faster fibres for the faster tasks indicates that in some circumstances motor unit recruitment during locomotion can match the contractile properties of the muscle fibres to the mechanical demands of the contraction.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle contractures represent the permanent shortening of a muscle-tendon unit, resulting in loss of elasticity and, in extreme cases, joint deformation. They may result from cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, muscular dystrophy, and other neuromuscular disorders. Contractures are the prototypic and most severe clinical presentation of increased passive mechanical muscle force in humans, often requiring surgical correction. Intraoperative experiments demonstrate that high muscle passive force is associated with sarcomeres that are abnormally stretched, although otherwise normal, with fewer sarcomeres in series. Furthermore, changes in the amount and arrangement of collagen in the extracellular matrix also increase muscle stiffness. Structural light and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that large bundles of collagen, referred to as perimysial cables, may be responsible for this increased stiffness and are regulated by interaction of a number of cell types within the extracellular matrix. Loss of muscle satellite cells may be related to changes in both sarcomeres and extracellular matrix. Future studies are required to determine the underlying mechanism for changes in muscle satellite cells and their relationship (if any) to contracture. A more complete understanding of this mechanism may lead to effective nonsurgical treatments to relieve and even prevent muscle contractures.},

Skeletal and cardiac muscles are known as striated muscles, because the ﬁlaments of actin and myosin that power their contraction are organized into repeating arrays, called sarcomeres, that have a striated microscopic appearance. Smooth muscle does not contain sarcomeres but uses the contraction of ﬁlaments of actin and myosin to constrict blood vessels and move the contents of hollow organs in the body.

	abstract = {In this study, we present a new model describing the mechanical behavior of the skeletal muscle during isometric contraction. This model is based on a former Hill-inspired model detailing the electromechanical behavior of the muscle based on the Huxley formulation. However, in this new multiscale model the muscle is represented at the Motor Unit ({MU}) scale. The proposed model is driven by a physiological input describing the ﬁring moments of the activated {MUs}. Deﬁnition of both voluntary and evoked {MU} recruitment schemes are described, enabling the study of both contractions in isometric conditions. During this type of contraction, there is no movement of the joints and the tendon-muscle complex remains at the same length. Moreover, some well-established macroscopic relationships such as force-length or force-velocity properties are considered. A comparison with a twitch model using the same input deﬁnition is provided with both recruitment schemes exhibiting limitations of twitch type models. Finally, the proposed model is validated with a comparison between simulated and recorded force proﬁles following eight electrical stimulation in isometric conditions. The simulated muscle force was generated to mimic the one recorded from the quadriceps of a patient implanted with a functional electrical stimulation neuroprosthesis. This validation demonstrates the ability of the proposed model to reproduce realistically the skeletal muscle contractions and to take into account subject-speciﬁc parameters.},

	abstract = {During muscle contractions, the muscle fascicles may shorten at a rate different from the muscle-tendon unit, and the ratio of these velocities is its gearing. Appropriate gearing allows fascicles to reduce their shortening velocities and allows them to operate at effective shortening velocities across a range of movements. Gearing of the muscle fascicles within the muscle belly is the result of rotations of the fascicles and bulging of the belly. Variable gearing can also occur as a result of tendon length changes that can be caused by changes in the relative timing of muscle activity for different mechanical tasks. Recruitment patterns of slow and fast fibres are crucial for achieving optimal muscle performance, and coordination between muscles is related to whole limb performance. Poor coordination leads to inefficiencies and loss of power, and optimal coordination is required for high power outputs and high mechanical efficiencies from the limb. This paper summarizes key studies in these areas of neuromuscular mechanics and results from studies where we have tested these phenomena on a cycle ergometer are presented to highlight novel insights. The studies show how muscle structure and neural activation interact to generate smooth and effective motion of the body.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY}
            Muscle fibres have a range of contractile properties from fast to slow. Traditional understanding of muscle fibre recruitment suggests that the slower fibres within a mixed muscle are used for all contractions including those at rapid speeds. However, mechanical arguments predict that some locomotor tasks are best performed by solely the faster fibres. Motor recruitment patterns can be indicated by the spectral properties of the myoelectric signals. High- and low-frequency myoelectric spectra that have similar spectral power indicate the activity of faster and slower motor units, respectively. In this study,the myoelectric signals in humans were measured from nine muscles of the leg during walking and running at 1.5, 3 and 4.5 m s–1. The myoelectric spectra for 20 points in each stride were calculated using wavelet techniques, and the spectral properties quantified using principal component analysis. Bursts of muscle activity were characterized by hysteresis in the myoelectric frequencies, with different frequencies occurring at different times, indicating time-varying shifts in the motor recruitment patterns. This hysteresis occurred at all locomotor speeds tested. It is likely that the different types of motor unit are recruited in a task-dependent fashion during locomotion.},

Methods: In 11 different hospital centres, {MUNIX} was assessed twice, at least 3 months apart (range 90-360 days), in tibialis anterior ({TA}), abductor pollicis brevis ({APB}), abductor digiti minimi ({ADM}) and deltoid muscles in 118 healthy subjects. {MUNIX} sum score 2, 3 and 4 were respectively the sum of the {MUNIX} of the {TA} and {ADM}, of the {TA}, {APB} and {ADM} and of the {TA}, {APB}, {ADM} and deltoid muscles.
Results: The repeatability of the {MUNIX} was better for sum scores than for single muscle recordings. The variability of the {MUNIX} was independent of sex, age, interval between measurements and was lower for experienced than non-experienced operators. The 95th percentile of the coefficient of variability of the {MUNIX} sum score 2, 3 and 4 were respectively 22\%, 18\% and 15\% for experienced operators.
Conclusions: The {MUNIX} technique must be performed by experienced operators on several muscles to reduce its variability and improve its reliability. Significance: A variation of the {MUNIX} sum score ≥ 20\% can be interpreted as a significant change of muscle innervation.},

Methods: Twenty-eight patients with {ALS} with a disease duration of 3–48 months were studied. Nerve conduction study of the median, ulnar, tibial, common peroneal, and sural nerves were done. Besides, electromyography ({EMG}) of cranio-bulbar, cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral muscles, and {MPS}-{MUNE}.
Results: {MUNE} is decreased in patients with {ALS}. {MUNE} was positively correlated with {CMAP} amplitude, medical research council ({MRC}) scale, and {ALS} functional rating scale ({ALS}-{FRS}). On the contrary, {MUNE} was negatively correlated with {MUAP} duration. Case detection by the {MUNE} methods was high as compared to that of {CMAP} amplitude.
Conclusions: {MUNE} is highly specific and more sensitive than {CMAP} amplitude in detecting the neurophysiologic abnormalities in patients with {ALS}. Case detection by {MUNE} is three times more than {CMAP} amplitudes.

The model has a minimal number of parameters and provides an explanation, at the molecular level, of many of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of steadily shortening muscle. In particular, the inf lexion in the force–velocity curve at a force approaching the isometric load is reproduced.

The hyperbolic force–velocity relationship of muscle, for a long time, has been regarded as a pure empirical description of the force–velocity data. Connections between mechanical manifestation in terms of force–velocity properties and the kinetics of the crossbridge cycle have only been established recently. In this review, we describe how the model of Huxley’s crossbridge kinetics can be transformed to the hyperbolic Hill equation, and link the changes in force–velocity properties to molecular events within the crossbridge cycle driven by {ATP} hydrolysis. This allows us to reinterpret some findings from previous studies on experimental interventions that altered the force–velocity relationship and gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.},

Additional isoforms, including products of tropomyosin, myosin light chain 1 fast, troponin T, titin, and nebulin genes, can be generated from the same gene through alternative splicing or use of alternative promoters. Myofibrillar protein isogenes are differentially expressed in various muscle types and fiber types but can be coexpressed within the same fiber. Isogenes are regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms; however, specific regulatory sequences and transcriptional factors have not yet been identified. The pattern of isogene expression varies during muscle development in relation to the different origin of myogenic cells and primary/secondary fiber generations and is affected by neural and hormonal influences. The variable expression of myofibrillar protein isoforms is a major determinant of the contractile properties of skeletal muscle fibers. The diversity among isomyosins is related to the differences in the parameters of chemomechanical transduction as {ATP} hydrolysis rate and shortening velocity. Troponin and tropomyosin isoforms determine the variable sensitivity to calcium, whereas titin isoforms dictate the elastic properties of muscle fibers at rest.

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle shows an enormous plasticity to adapt to stimuli such as contractile activity (endurance exercise, electrical stimulation, denervation), loading conditions (resistance training, microgravity), substrate supply (nutritional interventions) or environmental factors (hypoxia). The presented data show that adaptive structural events occur in both muscle fibres (myofibrils, mitochondria) and associated structures (motoneurons and capillaries). Functional adaptations appear to involve alterations in regulatory mechanisms (neuronal, endocrine and intracellular signalling), contractile properties and metabolic capacities. With the appropriate molecular techniques it has been demonstrated over the past 10 years that rapid changes in skeletal muscle {mRNA} expression occur with exercise in human and rodent species. Recently, gene expression profiling analysis has demonstrated that transcriptional adaptations in skeletal muscle due to changes in loading involve a broad range of genes and that {mRNA} changes often run parallel for genes in the same functional categories. These changes can be matched to the structural/functional adaptations known to occur with corresponding stimuli. Several signalling pathways involving cytoplasmic protein kinases and nuclear-encoded transcription factors are recognized as potential master regulators that transduce physiological stress into transcriptional adaptations of batteries of metabolic and contractile genes. Nuclear reprogramming is recognized as an important event in muscle plasticity and may be related to the adaptations in the myosin type, protein turnover, and the cytoplasma-to-myonucleus ratio. The accessibility of muscle tissue to biopsies in conjunction with the advent of high-throughput gene expression analysis technology points to skeletal muscle plasticity as a particularly useful paradigm for studying gene regulatory phenomena in humans.},

To this end, several methodologies are presented, including geometrically-based, physically-based, and data-driven approaches. On the other hand, the simulation of physiological muscle functions aims to identify the biomechanical controls responsible for realistic human motion. Estimating these muscle controls has been pursued through static and dynamic simulations. We review and discuss all these approaches, and conclude with suggestions for future research.},

The molecular mechanisms underpinning the signiﬁcant capacity for force generation and hypertrophy are not fully elucidated. {MicroRNAs} ({miRs}) are short non-coding {RNA} sequences that control gene expression via promotion of transcript breakdown and/or translational inhibition. Differences in basal {miR} expression may partially account for phenotypic differences in muscle mass and function between powerlifters and untrained age-matched controls. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis of 15 national level powerlifters (25.1 ± 5.8 years) and 13 untrained controls (24.1 ± 2.0 years). The powerlifters were stronger than the controls (isokinetic knee extension at 60◦/s: 307.8 ± 51.6 Nm vs. 211.9 ± 41.9 Nm, respectively P {\textless} 0.001), and also had larger muscle ﬁbers (type I {CSA} 9,122 ± 1,238 vs. 4,511 ± 798 µm2 p {\textless} 0.001 and type {II} {CSA} 11,100 ± 1,656 vs. 5,468 ± 1,477 µm2 p {\textless} 0.001). Of the 17 {miRs} species analyzed, 12 were differently expressed (p {\textless} 0.05) between groups with 7 being more abundant in powerlifters and ﬁve having lower expression. Established transcriptionally regulated {miR} downstream gene targets involved in muscle mass regulation, including myostatin and {MyoD}, were also differentially expressed between groups. Correlation analysis demonstrates the abundance of eight {miRs} was correlated to phenotype including peak strength, ﬁber size, satellite cell abundance, and ﬁber type regardless of grouping. The unique {miR} expression proﬁles between groups allow for categorization of individuals as either powerlifter or healthy controls based on a ﬁve {miR} signature ({miR}-126, -23b, -16, -23a, -15a) with considerable accuracy (100\%).

	abstract = {Sarcomere length is a key physiological parameter that affects muscle force output; however, our understanding of the scaling of human muscle from sarcomere to whole muscle is based primarily on cadaveric data. The aims of this study were to explore the in vivo relationship between passive fascicle length and passive sarcomere length at different muscle-tendon unit lengths and determine whether sarcomere and fascicle length relationships are the same in different regions of muscle. A microendoscopy needle probe capable of in vivo sarcomere imaging was inserted into a proximal location of the human tibialis anterior muscle at three different ankle positions [5° dorsiflexion, 5° plantar flexion ({PF}), and 15° {PF}] and one distal location at a constant ankle position (5° {PF} distal). Ultrasound imaging of tibialis anterior fascicles, centered on the location of the needle probe, was performed for each condition to estimate fascicle length. Sarcomere length and fascicle length increased with increasing muscle-tendon unit length, although the correlation between sarcomere length change and muscle fascicle length change was only moderate ( r
              2
               = 0.45). Passive sarcomere length was longer at the distal imaging site than the proximal site ( P = 0.01). When sarcomere number was estimated from sarcomere length and fascicle length, there were fewer sarcomeres in the fibers of distal location than the proximal location ( P = 0.01). These data demonstrate that fascicle length changes are representative of sarcomere length changes, although significant variability in sarcomere length exists within a muscle and sarcomere number per fiber is region-dependent.
            
            {NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} Sarcomere and fascicle lengths were measured in vivo from human muscle to examine the relationship between the different scales of organization. Changes in fascicle length were moderately related to sarcomere length changes; however, sarcomere length and number per fiber varied from proximal to distal regions of the muscle. Differences in average sarcomere operating lengths across the muscle suggest potentially different stresses or strains experienced within different regions of muscle.},

	abstract = {Mammalian skeletal muscles are comprised of many motor units, each containing a group of muscle fibres that have common contractile properties: these can be broadly categorized as slow and fast twitch muscle fibres. Motor units are typically recruited in an orderly fashion following the ‘size principle’, in which slower motor units would be recruited for low intensity contraction; a metabolically cheap and fatigue-resistant strategy. However, this recruitment strategy poses a mechanical paradox for fast, low intensity contractions, in which the recruitment of slower fibres, as predicted by the size principle, would be metabolically more costly than the recruitment of faster fibres that are more efficient at higher contraction speeds. Hence, it would be mechanically and metabolically more effective for recruitment strategies to vary in response to contraction speed so that the intrinsic efficiencies and contraction speeds of the recruited muscle fibres are matched to the mechanical demands of the task. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a novel, mixed cost function within a musculoskeletal simulation, which includes the metabolic cost of contraction, to predict the recruitment of different muscle fibre types across a range of loads and speeds. Our results show that a metabolically informed cost function predicts favoured recruitment of slower muscle fibres for slower and isometric tasks versus recruitment that favours faster muscles fibres for higher velocity contractions. This cost function predicts a change in recruitment patterns consistent with experimental observations, and also predicts a less expensive metabolic cost for these muscle contractions regardless of speed of the movement. Hence, our findings support the premise that varying motor recruitment strategies to match the mechanical demands of a movement task results in a mechanically and metabolically sensible way to deploy the different types of motor unit.},

	abstract = {The objective of this minireview is to describe the physiology and potential clinical benefits derived from inspiration. Recent animal and clinical studies demonstrate that one of the body’s natural mechanisms associated with inspiration is to harness the respiratory pump to enhance circulation to vital organs. There is evidence that large reductions in intrathoracic pressure ({\textgreater}20 {cmH}
              2
              O) caused by some inspiration maneuvers (e.g., Mueller maneuver) or pathophysiology (e.g., heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease) can result in adverse hemodynamic effects. However, the respiratory pump can improve cardiovascular functions when a “sweet spot” for generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration can be maintained at or less than 10 {cmH}
              2
              O below normal inspiration. These beneficial physiological effects include greater cardiac filling and output, lower intracranial pressure, cardiac baroreflex resetting, greater cerebral blood flow oscillatory patterns, increased vascular pressure gradients, and promoting sustained feedback between sympathetic nerve activity and arterial pressure. In addition to promoting gas exchange, data obtained from numerous animal and human experiments have provided new insights into “the other side of breathing”: the modulation of circulation by reduced intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration. The translation of these physiological relationships form the basis for the development and application of technologies designed to optimize the intrathoracic pump for treatment of clinical conditions associated with hypovolemia including cardiac arrest, orthostatic hypotension, hemorrhagic shock, and traumatic brain injury. Harnessing these fundamental mechanisms that control cardiopulmonary physiology provides opportunities to use inspiration as a potential tool to help treat significant and often life-threatening circulatory disorders.},

	abstract = {The heart and lungs are anatomically coupled through the pulmonary circulation and coexist within the sealed thoracic cavity, making the function of these systems highly interdependent. Understanding of the complex mechanical interactions between cardiac and pulmonary systems has evolved over the last century to appreciate that changes in respiratory mechanics significantly impact pulmonary hemodynamics and ventricular filling and ejection. Furthermore, given that the left and right heart share a common septum and are surrounded by the nondistensible pericardium, direct ventricular interaction is an important mediator of both diastolic and systolic performance. Although it is generally considered that cardiopulmonary interaction in healthy individuals at rest minimally affects hemodynamics, the significance during exercise is less clear. Adverse heart-lung interaction in respiratory disease is of growing interest as it may contribute to the pathogenesis of comorbid cardiovascular dysfunction and exercise intolerance in these patients. Similarly, heart failure represents a pathological uncoupling of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, whereby cardiac function may be impaired by the normal ventilatory response to exercise. Despite significant research contributions to this complex area, the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary interaction in the intact human and the clinical consequences of adverse interactions in common respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, particularly during exercise, remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this review is to present the key physiological principles of cardiopulmonary interaction as they pertain to resting and exercising hemodynamics in healthy humans and the clinical implications of adverse cardiopulmonary interaction during exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}), pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with a decline in skeletal muscle mass and function—termed sarcopenia—as mediated, in part, by muscle anabolic resistance. This metabolic phenomenon describes the impaired response of muscle protein synthesis ({MPS}) to the provision of dietary amino acids and practice of resistance-based exercise. Recent observations highlight the gut-muscle axis as a physiological target for combatting anabolic resistance and reducing risk of sarcopenia. Experimental studies, primarily conducted in animal models of aging, suggest a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota and muscle atrophy, mediated via the modulation of systemic amino acid availability and low-grade inﬂammation that are both physiological factors known to underpin anabolic resistance. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate the action of speciﬁc gut bacteria (Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium) to increase systemic amino acid availability and elicit an anti-inﬂammatory response in the intestinal lumen. Prospective lifestyle approaches that target the gut-muscle axis have recently been examined in the context of mitigating sarcopenia risk. These approaches include increasing dietary ﬁber intake that promotes the growth and development of gut bacteria, thus enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids ({SCFA}) (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). Prebiotic/probiotic/symbiotic supplementation also generates {SCFA} and may mitigate low-grade inﬂammation in older adults via modulation of the gut microbiota. Preliminary evidence also highlights the role of exercise in increasing the production of {SCFA}. Accordingly, lifestyle approaches that combine diets rich in ﬁber and probiotic supplementation with exercise training may serve to produce {SCFA} and increase microbial diversity, and thus may target the gut-muscle axis in mitigating anabolic resistance in older adults. Future mechanistic studies are warranted to establish the direct physiological action of distinct gut microbiota phenotypes on amino acid utilization and the postprandial stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in older adults.},

Muscle cross sections were stained for glycogen using a periodic acid-Schiff reaction, and single-fiber optical densities were determined to identify those fibers belonging to the stimulated motor unit. Innervation ratios were determined by counting the total number of muscle fibers in a motor unit in sections taken through several levels of the muscle. The average innervation ratios for the fast, fatigueable ({FF}) and fast, fatigue-resistant ({FR}) units were similar. However, the slow units (S) contained 61\% fewer fibers than the fast units ({FF} and {FR}). Muscle fibers belonging to S and {FR} units were similar in cross-sectional area, whereas fibers belonging to {FF} units were significantly larger than fibers belonging to either S or {FR} units. Additionally, muscle fibers innervated by a single motoneuron varied by two- to eightfold in cross-sectional area. Specific tensions, based on total cross-sectional area determined by summing the areas of all muscle fibers of each unit, showed a modest difference between fast and slow units, the means being 23.5 and 17.2 N X cm-2, respectively. Variations in maximum tension among units could be explained principally by innervation ratio, although fiber cross-sectional area and specific tension did contribute to differences between unit types.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(9): 2412–2418, 2020—Strength is a fundamental component of athletic performance and development. This investigation examined the long-term strength development of powerlifting ({PL}) athletes. The rate of strength gain/day was assessed in 1897 {PL} athletes (F 5 626, M 5 1,271) over a 15-year period (2003–2018). Independent T-tests explored sex differences in baseline absolute (kg) and relative strength (kg·body mass21 [bm]) recorded from the first competition, and strength gain/day (kg·d21). Analyses based on initial strength quartiles were conducted using one-way analysis of variances with significance set at p , 0.05. Bivariate correlational analysis tested for relationships between strength gain/day and baseline strength, the number of competitions, and mean days between competitions. Males had greater absolute (M: 513.3 6 99.8 kg, F: 289.4 6 55.7 kg, p , 0.001) and relative (M: 5.89 6 1.04 kg·bm21, F: 4.27 6 0.85 kg·bm21, p , 0.001) strength at baseline. Overall, strength gain/day (F: 0.12 6 0.69 kg·d21, M: 0.15 6 0.44 kg·d21, p 5 0.318) was similar between sexes. However, the strongest males showed a lower rate of strength improvement (0.102 kg·d21) compared with least strong males (0.211 kg·d21), p 5 0.010. No differences were observed across quartiles for females. Correlational analyses revealed significant but weak negative relationships between strength gain/day and the mean days between competitions for females (r2 5 20.120, p 5 0.003) and males (r2 5 2 0.190, p , 0.001). Similar relationships were observed for baseline strength (r2 5 20.073, p 5 0.009) and the number of competitions (r2 5 20.111, p , 0.001) for males. The results suggest similar strength adaptation between sexes. The strongest males improve more slowly, possibly due to a ceiling effect. Collectively, the findings provide novel evidence of real-world long-term strength adaptations that may be particularly useful to understand athlete development, to aid periodized programming, and to benchmark strength over time.},

Some generalizations based on more complicated “doseresponse” curves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental ecosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of similar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation of Liebig’s law follows from adaptation eﬀects. If the ﬁtness of an organism in a ﬁxed environment satisﬁes the Law of the Minimum then adaptation equalizes the pressure of essential factors and therefore acts against the Liebig’s law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly chosen pair “organism–environment” the Law of the Minimum typically holds, then, in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law.},

	abstract = {{JSim} is a simulation system for developing models, designing experiments, and evaluating hypotheses on physiological and pharmacological systems through the testing of model solutions against data. It is designed for interactive, iterative manipulation of the model code, handling of multiple data sets and parameter sets, and for making comparisons among different models running simultaneously or separately. Interactive use is supported by a large collection of graphical user interfaces for model writing and compilation diagnostics, defining input functions, model runs, selection of algorithms solving ordinary and partial differential equations, run-time multidimensional graphics, parameter optimization (8 methods), sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation for defining confidence ranges. {JSim} uses Mathematical Modeling Language ({MML}) a declarative syntax specifying algebraic and differential equations. Imperative constructs written in other languages ({MATLAB}, {FORTRAN}, C++, etc.) are accessed through procedure calls. {MML} syntax is simple, basically defining the parameters and variables, then writing the equations in a straightforward, easily read and understood mathematical form. This makes {JSim} good for teaching modeling as well as for model analysis for research.   For high throughput applications, {JSim} can be run as a batch job.  {JSim} can automatically translate models from the repositories for Systems Biology Markup Language ({SBML}) and {CellML} models. Stochastic modeling is supported. {MML} supports assigning physical units to constants and variables and automates checking dimensional balance as the first step in verification testing. Automatic unit scaling follows, e.g. seconds to minutes, if needed. The {JSim} Project File sets a standard for reproducible modeling analysis: it includes in one file everything for analyzing a set of experiments: the data, the models, the data fitting, and evaluation of parameter confidence ranges. {JSim} is open source; it and about 400 human readable open source physiological/biophysical models are available at http://www.physiome.org/jsim/.},

J Strength Cond Res 26(5): 1274–1280, 2012—This study investigated the effects of powerlifting gear on training volume and performance, deﬁned by the squat, bench press, and deadlift. Eighteen powerlifters (18–26 years) were randomized into either a group that trained and competed using compressive gear ({CG}) or without the gear ({NON}). Training volume, volume progression, and powerlifting performance were assessed before and after 10 weeks of training. Training volume increased in the ﬁrst 4 weeks for both groups. Volume lifted for squat and the totals were greater in the {CG}. There was an increase in squat (19.05 6 30.97 lb, p = 0.02), deadlift (19.05 6 21.17 lb, p = 0.001), and the total score (44.00 6 60.44 lb, p = 0.005) for both the groups. The improvements in squat ({CG} = 33.85 vs. {NON} = 5.74, p = 0.07) and totals ({CG} = 66.59 vs. {NON} = 23.67, p = 0.15) were greater in the {CG}. Both groups showed a signiﬁcant and similar increase in the Wilks scores (+13.54 points, p = 0.03). There was a trend toward greater volume progression in those wearing {CG} during the initial stages of training. Both the groups signiﬁcantly improved performance for the squat, and deadlift, and had higher totals, and Wilks scores, indicating signiﬁcant strength gains. The greater magnitude of improvements in the squat and totals for the {CG} lifters suggests an ergogenic potential of training with powerlifting gear.},

	abstract = {Background. Low-carbohydrate diets have recently grown in popularity among endurance athletes, yet little is known about the long-term ({\textgreater}4 wk) performance implications of consuming a low-carbohydrate high fat ketogenic diet ({LCKD}) in well-trained athletes.
Methods. Twenty male endurance-trained athletes (age 33 ± 11 y, body mass 80 ± 11 kg; {BMI} 24.7 ± 3.1 kg/m2) who habitually consumed a carbohydrate-based diet, self-selected into a high-carbohydrate ({HC}) group (n = 11, \%carbohydrate:protein:fat = 65:14:20), or a {LCKD} group (n = 9, 6:17:77). Both groups performed the same training intervention (endurance, strength and high intensity interval training ({HIIT})). Prior to and following successful completion of 12-weeks of diet and training, participants had their body composition assessed, and completed a 100 km time trial ({TT}), six second ({SS}) sprint, and a critical power test ({CPT}). During post-intervention testing the {HC} group consumed 30–60 g/h carbohydrate, whereas the {LCKD} group consumed water, and electrolytes.
Results. The {LCKD} group experienced a significantly greater decrease in body mass ({HC} − 0.8 kg, {LCKD} −5.9 kg; P = 0.006, effect size ({ES}): 0.338) and percentage body fat percentage ({HC} − 0.7\%, {LCKD} −5.2\%; P = 0.008, {ES}: 0.346). Fasting serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (β{HB}) significantly increased from 0.1 at baseline to 0.5 mmol/L in the {LCKD} group (P = 0.011, {ES}: 0.403) in week 12. There was no significant change in performance of the 100 km {TT} between groups ({HC} − 1.13 min·s, {LCKD} −4.07 min·s, P = 0.057, {ES}: 0.196). {SS} sprint peak power increased by 0.8 watts per kilogram bodyweight (w/kg) in the {LCKD} group, versus a −0.1 w/kg reduction in the {HC} group (P = 0.025, {ES}: 0.263). {CPT} peak power decreased by −0.7 w/kg in the {HC} group, and increased by 1.4 w/kg in the {LCKD} group (P = 0.047, {ES}: 0.212). Fat oxidation in the {LCKD} group was significantly greater throughout the 100 km {TT}.
Conclusions. Compared to a {HC} comparison group, a 12-week period of keto-adaptation and exercise training, enhanced body composition, fat oxidation during exercise, and specific measures of performance relevant to competitive endurance athletes.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle is a plastic tissue that adapts to exercise through fusion of muscle stem cells ({MuSCs}) with myofibers, a physiological process referred to as myonuclear accretion. However, it is still unclear whether myonuclear accretion is driven by increased mechanical loading per se, or occurs, at least in part, in response to exercise-induced muscle injury. Here, we developed a carefully monitored and individualized neuromuscular electrical stimulation ({NMES}) training protocol of the mouse plantar flexor muscles. Each {NMES} training session consisted of 80 isometric contractions at a submaximal mechanical intensity ∼ corresponding to 15\% of maximal tetanic force to avoid muscle damage. {NMES} trained mice were stimulated for 2 × 3 consecutive days separated by one day of rest, for a total of 6 sessions. Experiments were conducted on C57BL/6J and {BALB}/c males at 10-12 weeks of age. {NMES} led to a robust myonuclear accretion and higher {MuSC} content in gastrocnemius muscle of both mouse lines, without overt signs of muscle damage/regeneration or muscle hypertrophy or force improvement. This new mouse model of myonuclear accretion relying on the main function of skeletal muscles, i.e., force production in response to electrical stimuli, will be of utmost interest to further understand the role of {MuSCs} in skeletal muscle adaptations.},

	abstract = {The sarcomere force-length relationship has been extensively used to predict muscle force potential. The common practice is to measure the mean sarcomere length ({SL}) in a relaxed muscle at a single location and at a given length, and this mean {SL} is assumed to represent the {SLs} at other locations across the muscle. However, in a previous study, we found that {SLs} are highly non-uniform across an intact passive muscle. Moreover, {SL} non-uniformity increases during activation in single myoﬁbril experiments. Myoﬁbrils lack some structural proteins that comprise an intact muscle, and therefore, the increased {SL} dispersion upon activation seen in myoﬁbrils may not occur in intact whole muscle. The objectives of the current study were (i) to measure the distribution of {SLs} in an activated intact muscle; and (ii) to assess the feasibility of using the mean {SL} measured at a speciﬁc location of the muscle to predict muscle force. Using state-of-the-art multi-photon microscopy and a miniature tendon force transducer, in vivo sarcomeres in the mouse tibialis anterior were imaged simultaneously with muscle force during isometric tetanic contractions. We found that in vivo {SL} dispersion increased substantially during activation and reached average differences of ∼1.0 µm. These differences in {SL} are associated with theoretical force differences of 70–100\% of the maximal isometric force. Furthermore, {SLs} measured at a single location in the passive muscle were poor predictors of active force potential. Although mean {SLs} in the activated muscle were better predictors of force potential, predicted forces still differed by as much as 35\% from the experimentally measured maximal isometric forces.},

	abstract = {Sarcomere lengths have been a crucial outcome measure for understanding and explaining basic muscle properties and muscle function. Sarcomere lengths for a given muscle are typically measured at a single spot, often in the mid-belly of the muscle, and at a given muscle length. It is then assumed implicitly that the sarcomere length measured at this single spot represents the sarcomere lengths at other locations within the muscle, and force-length, force-velocity, and power-velocity properties of muscles are often implied based on these single sarcomere length measurements. Although, intuitively appealing, this assumption is yet to be supported by systematic evidence. The objective of this study was to measure sarcomere lengths at deﬁned locations along and across an intact muscle, at different muscle lengths. Using second harmonic generation ({SHG}) imaging technique, sarcomere patterns in passive mouse tibialis anterior ({TA}) were imaged in a non-contact manner at ﬁve selected locations (“proximal,” “distal,” “middle,” “medial,” and “lateral” {TA} sites) and at three different lengths encompassing the anatomical range of motion of the {TA}. We showed that sarcomere lengths varied substantially within small regions of the muscle and also for different sites across the entire {TA}. Also, sarcomere elongations with muscle lengthening were non-uniform across the muscle, with the highest sarcomere stretches occurring near the myotendinous junction. We conclude that muscle mechanics derived from sarcomere length measured from a small region of a muscle may not well-represent the sarcomere length and associated functional properties of the entire muscle.},

We created a wearable microscope equipped with a microendoscope for minimally invasive observation of sarcomere lengths and contractile dynamics in any major skeletal muscle. By electrically stimulating twitches via the microendoscope and visualizing the sarcomere displacements, we monitored single motor unit contractions in soleus and vastus lateralis muscles of healthy individuals. Control experiments veriﬁed that these evoked twitches involved neuromuscular transmission and faithfully reported muscle force generation. In poststroke patients with spasticity of the biceps brachii, we found involuntary microscopic contractions and sarcomere length abnormalities.

	abstract = {Impedance cardiography ({ICG}) is a branch of bioimpedance primarily concerned with the determination of left ventricular stroke volume ({SV}). As implemented, using the transthoracic approach, the technique involves applying a current field longitudinally across a segment of thorax by means of a constant magnitude, high frequency, low amplitude alternating current ({AC}). By Ohm’s Law, the voltage difference measured within the current field is proportional to the electrical impedance Z (Ω). Without ventilatory or cardiac activity, Z is known as the transthoracic, static base impedance Z0. Upon ventricular ejection, a characteristic time dependent cardiac-synchronous pulsatile impedance change is obtained, ∆Z(t), which, when placed electrically in parallel with Z0, constitutes the time-variable total transthoracic impedance Z(t). ∆Z(t) represents a dual-element composite waveform, which comprises both the radially-oriented volumetric expansion of and axially-directed forward blood flow within both great thoracic arteries. In its majority, however, ∆Z(t) is known to primarily emanate from the ascending aorta. Conceptually, commonly implemented methods assume a volumetric origin for the peak systolic upslope of ∆Z(t), (i.e. {dZ}/dtmax), with the presumed units of Ω·s–1. A recently introduced method assumes the rapid ejection of forward flowing blood in earliest systole causes significant changes in the velocity-induced blood resistivity variation (∆ρb(t), Ωcm·s–1), and it is the peak rate of change of the blood resistivity variation dρb(t)/dtmax (Ωcm·s–2) that is the origin of {dZ}/dtmax. As a consequence of {dZ}/dtmax peaking in the time domain of peak aortic blood acceleration, dv/dtmax (cm·s–2), it is suggested that {dZ}/dtmax is an ohmic mean acceleration analog (Ω·s–2) and not a mean flow or velocity surrogate as generally assumed. As conceptualized, the normalized value, {dZ}/dtmax/Z0, is a dimensionless ohmic mean acceleration equivalent (s–2), and more precisely, the electrodynamic equivalent of peak aortic reduced average blood acceleration ({PARABA}, d{\textless}v{\textgreater}/dtmax/R, s–2). As necessary for stroke volume calculation, {dZ}/dtmax/Z0 must undergo square root transformation to yield an ohmic mean flow velocity equivalent. To compute {SV}, the square root of the dimensionless ohmic mean acceleration equivalent ([{dZ}/dtmax/Z0]0.5, s–1) is multiplied by a volume of electrically participating thoracic tissue ({VEPT}, {mL}) and left ventricular ejection time ({TLVE}, s). To find the bulk volume of the thoracic contents (i.e. {VEPT}), established methods implement exponential functions of measured thoracic length (L(cm)n) or height-based thoracic length equivalents (0.01×\%H(cm)n). The new method conceptualizes {VEPT} as the intrathoracic blood volume ({ITBV}, {mL}), which is approximated through allometric equivalents of body mass ({aMb}). In contrast to the classical twoelement parallel conduction model, the new method comprises a three-compartment model, which incorporates excess extravascular lung water ({EVLW}) as a component of both Z0 and {VEPT}. To fully appreciate the evolution and analytical justification for impedance-derived {SV} equations, a review of the basics of pulsatile blood flow is in order.},

Mean sarcomere lengths at 10° plantarflexion were 2.84±0.09 μm (mean ±S.E.M.), near the optimal length for sarcomere force generation. Sarcomere lengths were 3.43±0.09 μm at 20° dorsiflexion, indicating that they were longer than optimal length when the ankle was in dorsiflexion and the muscle was inactive.

Hill over seven decades ago to illustrate the relationship between shortening velocity and load is still the predominant method used to characterize muscle performance, even though it has been regarded as purely empirical and lacking precision in predicting velocities at high and low loads. Popularity of the Hill equation has been sustained perhaps because of historical reasons, but its simplicity is certainly attractive. The descriptive nature of the equation does not diminish its role as a useful tool in our quest to understand animal locomotion and optimal design of muscle-powered devices like bicycles. In this Review, an analysis is presented to illustrate the connection between the historic Hill equation and the kinetics of myosin cross-bridge cycle based on the latest findings on myosin motor interaction with actin filaments within the structural confines of a sarcomere. In light of the new data and perspective, some previous studies of force–velocity relations of muscle are revisited to further our understanding of muscle mechanics and the underlying biochemical events, specifically how extracellular and intracellular environment, protein isoform expression, and posttranslational modification of contractile and regulatory proteins change the interaction between myosin and actin that in turn alter muscle force, shortening velocity, and the relationship between them.},

This study aimed to gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying short-term orthostatic {BP} recovery patterns in a realworld clinical setting with (pre)syncope patients. Setting and Participants: In a prospective cohort study, the active lying-to-standing test was performed in suspected (pre)syncope patients in the emergency department with continuous noninvasive ﬁnger arterial {BP} measurement. Measures: Changes in systolic {BP}, cardiac output ({CO}), and systemic vascular resistance ({SVR}) were studied in normal {BP} recovery, initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed {BP} recovery, and sustained orthostatic hypotension.
Results: In normal recovery (n ¼ 47), {DBP} at nadir was À24 (23) {mmHg}, with a {CO} change of þ10 (21\%) and {SVR} of À23 (21\%). In initial orthostatic hypotension (n ¼ 7) {DBP} at nadir was À49 (17) {mmHg} and {CO} and {SVR} change was À5 (46\%) and À29 (58\%), respectively. Delayed recovery (n ¼ 12) differed signiﬁcantly from normal recovery 30 seconds after standing, with a {DBP} of À32 (19) vs 1 (16) {mmHg}, respectively. Delayed recovery was associated with a signiﬁcant difference in {SVR} changes compared to normal recovery, À17 (26\%) vs þ4 (20\%), respectively. There was no difference in {CO} changes. In sustained orthostatic hypotension (n ¼ 16), {DBP} at 180 seconds after standing was À39 (21) {mmHg}, with changes in {CO} of À16 (31\%) and {SVR} of À9 (20\%).
Conclusions/Implications: Hemodynamic patterns following active standing are heterogeneous and differ across orthostatic {BP} recovery patterns, suggesting that volume status, medication use, and autonomic dysfunction should all be taken into account when evaluating these patients. Moreover, results suggest that a delayed {BP} recovery is associated with an impaired increase in {SVR} in a signiﬁcant proportion of individuals, implying that physicians treating older adults with hypertension should consider the possible negative effect of intensive hypertension treatment on initial orthostatic blood pressure control.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
          
            Ribosomes are the macromolecular engines of protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis is stimulated by exercise, but the contribution of ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA}) copy number and methylation to exercise-induced {rDNA} transcription is unclear. To investigate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis with exercise, a time course of skeletal muscle biopsies was obtained from 30 participants (18 men and 12 women; 31 ±8 yrs, 25 ±4 kg/m
            2
            ) at rest and 30 min, 3h, 8h, and 24h after acute endurance (n=10, 45 min cycling, 70\% {VO}
            2
            max) or resistance exercise (n=10, 4 x 7 x 2 exercises); 10 control participants underwent biopsies without exercise. {rDNA} transcription and dosage were assessed using {qPCR} and whole genome sequencing. {rDNA} promoter methylation was investigated using {massARRAY} {EpiTYPER}, and global {rDNA} {CpG} methylation was assessed using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Ribosome biogenesis and
            {MYC}
            transcription were associated with resistance but not endurance exercise, indicating preferential up-regulation during hypertrophic processes. With resistance exercise, ribosome biogenesis was associated with {rDNA} gene dosage as well as epigenetic changes in enhancer and non-canonical {MYC}-associated areas in {rDNA}, but not the promoter. A mouse model of
            in vivo
            metabolic {RNA} labeling and genetic myonuclear fluorescent labeling validated the effects of an acute hypertrophic stimulus on ribosome biogenesis and
            Myc
            transcription, and corroborated {rDNA} enhancer and Myc-associated methylation alterations specifically in myonuclei. This study provides the first information on skeletal muscle genetic and {rDNA} gene-wide epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis in response to exercise, revealing novel roles for {rDNA} dosage and {CpG} methylation.

	abstract = {Satellite cells support adult skeletal muscle fiber adaptations to loading in numerous ways. The fusion of satellite cells, driven by cell-a­ utonomous and/or extrinsic factors, contributes new myonuclei to muscle fibers, associates with load-­induced hypertrophy, and may support focal membrane damage repair and long-t­ erm myonuclear transcriptional output. Recent studies have also revealed that satellite cells communicate within their niche to mediate muscle remodeling in response to resistance exercise, regulating the activity of numerous cell types through various mechanisms such as secretory signaling and cell–c­ ell contact. Muscular adaptation to resistance and endurance activity can be initiated and sustained for a period of time in the absence of satellite cells, but satellite cell participation is ultimately required to achieve full adaptive potential, be it growth, function, or proprioceptive coordination. While significant progress has been made in understanding the roles of satellite cells in adult muscle over the last few decades, many conclusions have been extrapolated from regeneration studies. This review highlights our current understanding of satellite cell behavior and contributions to adaptation outside of regeneration in adult muscle, as well as the roles of satellite cells beyond fusion and myonuclear accretion, which are gaining broader recognition.},

	abstract = {An inﬂuential book written by A. Mosso in the late nineteenth century proposed that fatigue that “at ﬁrst sight might appear an imperfection of our body, is on the contrary one of its most marvelous perfections. The fatigue increasing more rapidly than the amount of work done saves us from the injury which lesser sensibility would involve for the organism” so that “muscular fatigue also is at bottom an exhaustion of the nervous system.” It has taken more than a century to conﬁrm Mosso’s idea that both the brain and the muscles alter their function during exercise and that fatigue is predominantly an emotion, part of a complex regulation, the goal of which is to protect the body from harm. Mosso’s ideas were supplanted in the English literature by those of A. V. Hill who believed that fatigue was the result of biochemical changes in the exercising limb muscles – “peripheral fatigue” – to which the central nervous system makes no contribution. The past decade has witnessed the growing realization that this brainless model cannot explain exercise performance. This article traces the evolution of our modern understanding of how the {CNS} regulates exercise speciﬁcally to insure that each exercise bout terminates whilst homeostasis is retained in all bodily systems. The brain uses the symptoms of fatigue as key regulators to insure that the exercise is completed before harm develops. These sensations of fatigue are unique to each individual and are illusionary since their generation is largely independent of the real biological state of the athlete at the time they develop. The model predicts that attempts to understand fatigue and to explain superior human athletic performance purely on the basis of the body’s known physiological and metabolic responses to exercise must fail since subconscious and conscious mental decisions made by winners and losers, in both training and competition, are the ultimate determinants of both fatigue and athletic performance.},

Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2–54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6–31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9\%, 8.9\%, and 20.9\% of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2\%, 16.4\%, and 18.5\%, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in {OpenSim} version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2179–2186, 2021—Previous investigations of 1 repetition maximum bench press (1RM {BP}) performance have been either descriptive or have explored a limited number of contributing variables. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interplay between structural, technical, and neuromuscular factors in relation to 1RM {BP} in competitive powerlifters. Thirteen national and international level male powerlifters (26 6 9 years, 178 6 6 cm, and 93.8 6 9.9 kg) visited the laboratory twice. Anthropometric and ultrasound measures were taken on the first visit, whereas performance measures (voluntary activation level, isokinetic strength, and kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic measurements during 1RM {BP}) were recorded on the second visit. Correlation and multiple regression were used to investigate the contribution of structural, technical, and neuromuscular variables to 1RM {BP} corrected for body mass using the Wilks coefficient. The highest degree of association was shown for structural (lean and bone mass, brachial index, arm circumference, and agonist cross-sectional area [{CSA}]; r 5 0.58–0.74) followed by neuromuscular factors (elbow and shoulder flexion strength; r 5 0.57–0.71), whereas technical factors did not correlate with 1RM {BP} performance (r \# 0.49). The multiple regression showed that lean body mass, brachial index, and isometric shoulder flexion torque predicted 59\% of the common variance in 1RM {BP}. These data suggest that in a sample of elite competitive powerlifters, multiple factors contribute to 1RM {BP} with variables such as lean body mass, the agonist {CSA}, brachial index, and strength of the elbow and shoulder flexors being the greatest predictors of performance.},

	abstract = {Objective The commensal microbiota, host immunity and metabolism participate in a signalling network, with diet inﬂuencing each component of this triad. In addition to diet, many elements of a modern lifestyle inﬂuence the gut microbiota but the degree to which exercise affects this population is unclear. Therefore, we explored exercise and diet for their impact on the gut microbiota. Design Since extremes of exercise often accompany extremes of diet, we addressed the issue by studying professional athletes from an international rugby union squad. Two groups were included to control for physical size, age and gender. Compositional analysis of the microbiota was explored by 16S {rRNA} amplicon sequencing. Each participant completed a detailed food frequency questionnaire.
Results As expected, athletes and controls differed signiﬁcantly with respect to plasma creatine kinase (a marker of extreme exercise), and inﬂammatory and metabolic markers. More importantly, athletes had a higher diversity of gut micro-organisms, representing 22 distinct phyla, which in turn positively correlated with protein consumption and creatine kinase.
Conclusions The results provide evidence for a beneﬁcial impact of exercise on gut microbiota diversity but also indicate that the relationship is complex and is related to accompanying dietary extremes.},

The controversial points of view impede the systematic use of the notion of adaptation energy despite experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the response to many harmful factors often has general non-speciﬁc form and we suggest that the mechanisms of physiological adaptation admit a very general and nonspeciﬁc description.},

	abstract = {The force–velocity (F–V ) properties of isolated muscles or muscle fibers have been well studied in humans and other animals. However, determining properties of individual muscles in vivo remains a challenge because muscles usually function within a synergistic group. Modeling has been used to estimate the properties of an individual muscle from the experimental measurement of the muscle group properties. While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F–V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors. The first model (Mdl1) assumed that the percent contributions of individual muscles to group force and power were based upon the muscles’ cross-sectional area and were constant across the different isotonic loads applied to the muscle group. The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F–V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but because of differences in muscle architecture, the muscles’ contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions with independent estimates of the muscles’ contributions based upon sonomicrometry measurements of muscle length. We found that predictions from Mdl2 were not significantly different from sonomicrometry-based estimates while those from Mdl1 were significantly different. The results of this study show that incorporating appropriate fiber properties and muscle architecture is necessary to parse the individual muscles’ contributions to the group F–V properties.},

	abstract = {Muscle ﬁbers are syncytial postmitotic cells that can acquire exogenous nuclei from resident muscle stem cells, called satellite cells. Myonuclei are added to muscle ﬁbers by satellite cells during conditions such as load-induced hypertrophy. It is difﬁcult to dissect the molecular contributions of resident versus satellite cell-derived myonuclei during adaptation due to the complexity of labeling distinct nuclear populations in multinuclear cells without label transference between nuclei. To sidestep this barrier, we used a genetic mouse model where myonuclear {DNA} can be speciﬁcally and stably labeled via nonconstitutive H2B-{GFP} at any point in the lifespan. Resident myonuclei (Mn) were {GFP}-tagged in vivo before 8 wk of progressive weighted wheel running ({PoWeR}) in adult mice ({\textgreater}4-mo-old). Resident þ satellite cell-derived myonuclei (Mn þ {SC} Mn) were labeled at the end of {PoWeR} in a separate cohort. Following myonuclear isolation, promoter {DNA} methylation proﬁles acquired with low-input reduced representation bisulﬁte sequencing ({RRBS}) were compared to deduce epigenetic contributions of satellite cell-derived myonuclei during adaptation. Resident myonuclear {DNA} has hypomethylated promoters in genes related to protein turnover, whereas the addition of satellite cell-derived myonuclei shifts myonuclear methylation proﬁles to favor transcription factor regulation and cellcell signaling. By comparing myonucleus-speciﬁc methylation proﬁling to previously published single-nucleus transcriptional analysis in the absence (Mn) versus the presence of satellite cells (Mn þ {SC} Mn) with {PoWeR}, we provide evidence that satellite cellderived myonuclei may preferentially supply speciﬁc ribosomal proteins to growing myoﬁbers and retain an epigenetic “memory” of prior stem cell identity. These data offer insights on distinct epigenetic myonuclear characteristics and contributions during adult muscle growth.},

Effects of different volume-equated resistance training loading strategies on muscular adaptations in well-trained men. J Strength Cond Res 28(10): 2909–2918, 2014 —Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass. Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs, the principle of speciﬁcity, which states that adaptations are speciﬁc to the nature of the applied stimulus, dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others. Research is lacking, however, as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program vs. a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects. Seventeen young men were randomly assigned to either a hypertrophy-type resistance training group that performed 3 sets of 10 repetition maximum ({RM}) with 90 seconds rest or a strength-type resistance training ({ST}) group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with a 3-minute rest interval. After 8 weeks, no signiﬁcant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii. Signiﬁcant strength differences were found in favor of {ST} for the 1RM bench press, and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat. In conclusion, this study showed that both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size, but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength.},

Effects of augmented eccentric load bench press training on one repetition maximum performance and electromyographic activity in trained powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1512–1519, 2021—Augmented eccentric load ({AEL}) training has been shown to elicit greater lower-body muscular strength increases and faster performance improvements compared with traditional strength training. However, it is unknown whether {AEL} training could provide similar improvements in upper-body muscular strength. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of a 4week {AEL} training program on bench press one repetition maximum (1RM) strength, bar kinetics and kinematics, and surface electromyography ({EMG}) activity. Eight competitive powerlifters completed 5 training sessions consisting of 7 sets of a single repetition with up to 5 minutes rest between sets. Each session was completed at a predetermined {AEL} percentage consisting of 90\% 1RM for concentric and supramaximal loads ranging from 105 to 125\% 1RM during the eccentric phase with the use of eccentric hooks. After 4 weeks of {AEL} training, 1RM performance significantly increased from pretest to posttest (116.62 6 27.48–124.28 6 26.96 kg, p 5 0.001). In addition, {EMG} amplitude of the pectoralis major decreased during the 125\% {AEL} session to 59.86 6 15.36\% of pretest 1RM {EMG} values (p 5 0.049, effect sizes [{ESs}] 5 0.69). Furthermore, peak power of 1RM increased by 36.67\% from pretest to posttest (p 5 0.036, {ES} 5 0.58). These study findings suggest that incorporating {AEL} bench press training into a 4-week training cycle may be a novel strategy to improve 1RM performance in competitive powerlifters in a short period.},

Previous investigators have reported that high-intensity exercise uncouples {VE} from {VCO}2; however, they did not measure the {PaCO}2 and {VD}/{VT} components of the overall relationship. In an attempt to provide a more complete analysis of the effects of high-intensity exercise on the {VE}-{VCO}2 relationship, we undertook an investigation where five subjects volunteered to perform three steady-state tests ({SS}1, {SS}2, {SS}3) at 60 W. One week after {SS}1 each subject was required to perform repeated 1-min bouts of exercise corresponding to a work rate of approximately 140\% of maximal oxygen uptake ({VO}2max). Two and 24 h later the subjects performed {SS}2 and {SS}3, respectively. This exercise intervention caused {PaCO}2 during {SS}2 and {SS}3 to be regulated (P less than 0.01) approximately 4 Torr below the control ({SS}1) value of 38.8 Torr. Additionally, significant alterations were noted for {VCO}2 with corresponding values of 1.15 ({SS}1), 1.10 ({SS}2), and 1.04 ({SS}3) l/min. No changes were noted in either {VD}/{VT} or {VE}. In summary, it seems reasonable to suggest that the disproportionate increase in {VE} with respect to {VCO}2 noted in earlier work does not reflect an uncoupling. Rather the slope of the {VE}-{VCO}2 relationship is increased in a predictable manner as described by the modified alveolar ventilation equation.},

Indeed, recent pharmacological studies of a number of adaptogens have provided a rationale for these effects also at the molecular level. It was discovered that the stress—protective activity of adaptogens was associated with regulation of homeostasis via several mechanisms of action, which was linked with the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis and the regulation of key mediators of stress response, such as molecular chaperons (e.g., {HSP}70), stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 ({JNK}1), Forkhead box O ({FOXO}) transcription factor {DAF}-16, cortisol and nitric oxide.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of muscle mass and the level of force on the contraction-induced rise in heart rate. We conducted an experimental study in a sample of 28 healthy men between 20 and 30 yr of age (power: 95\%, α: 5\%). Smokers, obese subjects, and those who performed regular physical activity over a certain amount of energetic expenditure were excluded from the study. The participants exerted two types of isometric contractions: handgrip and turning a 40-cm-diameter wheel. Both were sustained to exhaustion at 20 and 50\% of maximal force. Twenty-five subjects finished the experiment. Heart rate increased a mean of 15.1 beats/min [95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 5.5–24.6] from 20 to 50\% handgrip contractions, and 20.7 beats/min (95\% {CI}: 11.9–29.5) from 20 to 50\% wheel-turn contractions. Heart rate also increased a mean of 13.3 beats/min (95\% {CI}: 10.4–16.1) from handgrip to wheel-turn contractions at 20\% maximal force, and 18.9 beats/min (95\% {CI}: 9.8–28.0) from handgrip to wheel-turn contractions at 50\% maximal force. We conclude that the magnitude of the heart rate increase during isometric exercise is related to the intensity of the contraction and the mass of the contracted muscle.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1213–1219, 2020—Powerlifting ({PL}) requires athletes to achieve the highest possible “total” weight lifted across squat, bench press, and deadlift. Athletes compete multiple times per year; however, it is not well understood how often {PL} athletes should compete to facilitate maximal strength performance. This study investigated the effect of competition frequency on strength (relative and absolute) in {PL} athletes over a 12-month period. Results across all male (n 5 563, mean 6 {SD}; age; 28 6 10 years, body mass; 89.3 6 19.3 kg) and female (n 5 437, age; 31 6 11 years, body mass; 70.1 6 15.8 kg) {PL} athletes were collated. Total competition scores were used to calculate absolute and relative strength for each competition. Linear mixed models with random effects, and effect sizes 6 95\% confidence intervals compared competition frequency and total score for (a) all, (b) male, and (c) female competition entries, respectively. The association between total score at each competition was assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the same independent variables. Results demonstrate greater absolute strength at competition 2 for all athletes (5.1\%: p 5 0.043: d 5 0.16) and males (2.9\%: p 5 0.049: d 5 0.15). For females, absolute strength was greater at competition 5 compared to 1 (12.0\%: p 5 0.001: d 5 0.65) and 2 (9.6\%: p 5 0.007: d 5 0.50). Weak positive correlations for relative strength and number of times competed for males were evident between competitions 1 to 4 (r2 5 0.070–0.085, p 5 0.003–0.043). For females, 3 competitions weakly correlated with absolute strength (r2 5 0.106, p 5 0.016). {PL} athletes who compete multiple times per year are more likely to achieve higher totals; however, there is an upper limit to the number of competitions (4 per year) that seem to allow a performance increase.},

	abstract = {Background: Compared to other pulmonary function tests, there is a lack of standardization regarding how a maximum voluntary ventilation ({MVV}) maneuver is performed. Specifically, little is known about the variation in breathing frequency ({fR}) and its potential impact on the accuracy of test results. This study examines the effect of several preselected values for {fR} and one self-selected {fR} ({fRself}) on {MVV}.
Methods: Ten participants performed {MVV} maneuvers at various {fR} values, ranging from 50 to 130 breaths·min− 1 in 10 breaths·min− 1 intervals and at one {fRself}. Three identical trials with 2-min rest periods were conducted at each {fR}, and the sequence in which {fR} was tested was randomized. Ventilation and related parameters were measured directly by gas exchange analysis via a metabolic measurement system.
Results: A third-order polynomial regression analysis showed that {MVV} = − 0.0001({fR})3 + 0.0258({fR})2–1.38({fR}) + 96.9 at preselected {fR} and increased up to approximately 100 breaths·min− 1 (r2 = 0.982, P {\textless} 0.001). Paired t-tests indicated that average {MVV} values obtained at all preselected {fR} values, but not {fRself}, were significantly lower than the average maximum value across all participants. A linear regression analysis revealed that tidal volume ({VT}) = − 2.63({MVV}) + 300.4 at preselected {fR} (r2 = 0.846, P {\textless} 0.001); however, this inverse relationship between {VT} and {MVV} did not remain true for the self-selected {fR}. The {VT} obtained at this {fR} (90.9 ± 19.1\% of maximum) was significantly greater than the {VT} associated with the most similar {MVV} value (at a preselected {fR} of 100 breaths·min− 1, 62.0 ± 10.4\% of maximum; 95\% confidence interval of difference: (17.5, 40.4\%), P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates the shortcomings of the current lack of standardization in {MVV} testing and establishes data-driven recommendations for optimal {fR}. The true {MVV} was obtained with a self-selected {fR} (mean ± {SD}: 69.9 ± 22.3 breaths·min− 1) or within a preselected {fR} range of 110–120 breaths·min− 1. Until a comprehensive reference equation is established, it is advised that {MVV} be measured directly using these guidelines. If an individual is unable to perform or performs the maneuver poorly at a self-selected {fR}, ventilating within a mandated {fR} range of 110–120 breaths·min− 1 may also be acceptable.},

The purpose of this study was to examine concentric and eccentric force-velocity relationships of the knee extensors of 30 young, healthy females at seven velocities between 30 and 2lO0/secusing the Kinetic Communicator. The average force produced by the quadriceps during three concentric and three eccentric contractions was calculated at each velocity. The force-velocity relationships were graphed and analyzed using linear regression techniques. Results showed that the mean slope of the combined linear regression lines of concentric data was -0.55, which is significantly different from a zero slope. This indicates that concentric force of the knee extensors decreases as velocity increases. The mean slope of the combined linear regression lines of the eccentric data was -0.04, indicating no significant change in eccentric force with an increase in velocity. It appears, therefore, that in the knee extensors of healthy, young females, concentric force decreases as velocity increases to 210°/ sec, while eccentric force remains the same. Both concentric and eccentric work are often emphasized in strength training programs. It is, therefore, important for professionals involved in the rehabilitation or training of patients and athletes to be aware of differences between eccentric and concentric force-velocity relationships.},

	abstract = {The concept of biological adaptation was closely connected to some mathematical, engineering and physical ideas from the very beginning. Cannon in his “The wisdom of the body” (1932) systematically used the engineering vision of regulation. In 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. Selye did not use the language of mathematics systematically, but the formalization of his phenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to veriﬁable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and the universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors was discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious symptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and volatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on ﬁnancial time series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new experiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of depression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were developed: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several families of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the ﬁrst group of models was based on Selye’s concept of adaptation energy and used ﬁtness estimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor bifurcation and on the advection–diffusion model for distribution of population in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of models and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention to the results of the last ten years and open questions.},

A systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1753–1762, 2022—Fitness professionals routinely employ a variety of resistance training exercises in program design as a strategy to enhance muscular adaptations. However, it remains uncertain whether such an approach offers advantages over a fixed-exercise selection. The objective of this review was to review the effects of exercise variation on muscle hypertrophy and strength. A search of the literature was conducted using {PubMed}/{MEDLINE}, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Eight studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. The combined total sample of the studies was N 5 241, comprising all young men. The methodological quality of included studies was considered “good” and “excellent” based on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale. The available studies indicate that varying exercise selection can influence muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. Some degree of systematic variation seems to enhance regional hypertrophic adaptations and maximize dynamic strength, whereas excessive, random variation may compromise muscular gains. We conclude that exercise variation should be approached systematically with a focus on applied anatomical and biomechanical constructs; on the contrary, employing different exercises that provide a redundant stimulus, as well as excessive rotation of different exercises (i.e., high frequency of change), may actually hinder muscular adaptations.},

Therefore, with metabolic ﬂux, {pH} is altered in a medium with ﬁnite buffer capacity. Apparent equilibrium constants and maximum enzyme velocities, which are functions of {pH}, are also altered. We augmented an earlier mathematical model of skeletal muscle glycogenolysis with {pH}-dependent enzyme kinetics and reaction equilibria to compute the time course of {pH} changes. Analysis shows that kinetics and ﬁnal equilibrium states of the closed system are highly constrained by the {pH}-dependent parameters. This kinetic model of glycogenolysis, coupled to creatine kinase and adenylate kinase, simulated published experiments made with a cell-free enzyme mixture to reconstitute the network and to synthesize {PCr} and lactate in vitro. Using the enzyme kinetic and thermodynamic data in the literature, the simulations required minimal adjustments of parameters to describe the data. These results show that incorporation of appropriate physical chemistry of the reactions with accurate kinetic modeling gives a reasonable simulation of experimental data and is necessary for a physically correct representation of the metabolic network.

	abstract = {This study investigated the influence of contraction speed and type on the human ability to rapidly increase torque and utilise the available maximum voluntary torque ({MVT}) as well as the neuromuscular mechanisms underpinning any effects. Fifteen young, healthy males completed explosive voluntary knee extensions in five conditions: isometric ({ISO}), and both concentric and eccentric at two constant accelerations of 500 deg s−2 ({CONSLOW} and {ECCSLOW}) and 2000 deg s−2 ({CONFAST} and {ECCFAST}). Explosive torque and quadriceps {EMG} were recorded every 25 ms up to 150 ms from their respective onsets and normalised to the available {MVT} and {EMG} at {MVT}, respectively, specific to that joint angle and velocity. Neural efficacy (explosive voluntary:evoked octet torque) was also measured, and torque data were entered into a Hill-type muscle model to estimate muscle performance. Explosive torques normalised to {MVT} (and normalised muscle forces) were greatest in the concentric followed by the isometric and eccentric conditions, and in the fast compared with slow speeds within the same contraction type ({CONFAST}{\textgreater}{CONSLOW}{\textgreater}{ISO}, and {ECCFAST}{\textgreater}{ECCSLOW}). Normalised explosive-phase {EMG} and neural efficacy were greatest in concentric conditions, followed by isometric and eccentric conditions, but were similar for fast and slow contractions of the same type. Thus, distinct neuromuscular activation appeared to explain the effect of contraction type but not speed on normalised explosive torque, suggesting the speed effect is an intrinsic contractile property. These results provide novel evidence that the ability to rapidly increase torque/force and utilise the available {MVT} is influenced by both contraction type and speed, owing to neural and contractile mechanisms, respectively.},

J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2170–2178, 2021—The study was designed to investigate the validity of different technologies used to determine movement velocity in resistance training. Twenty-four experienced powerlifters (18 male and 6 female; age, 25.1 6 5.1 years) completed a progressive loading test in the squat, bench press, and conventional deadlift until reaching their 1 repetition maximum. Peak and mean velocity were simultaneously recorded with 4 field-based systems: {GymAware} ({GA}), {FitroDyne} ({FD}), {PUSH} ({PU}), and Beast Sensor ({BS}). 3D motion capturing was used to calculate specific gold standard trajectory references for each device. {GA} provided the most accurate output across exercises (r 5 0.99–1, {ES} 5 20.05 to 0.1). {FD} showed similar results for peak velocity (r 5 1, standardized mean bias [{ES}] 5 20.1 to 20.02) but considerably less validity for mean velocity (r 5 0.92–0.95, {ES} 5 20.57 to 20.29). Reasonably valid to highly valid output was provided by {PU} in all exercises (r 5 0.91–0.97, {ES} 5 20.5 to 0.28) and by {BS} in the bench press and for mean velocity in the squat (r 5 0.87–0.96, {ES} 5 20.5 to 20.06). However, {BS} did not reach the thresholds for reasonable validity in the deadlift and for peak velocity in the squat, mostly due to high standardized mean bias ({ES} 5 20.78 to 20.63). In conclusion, different technologies should not be used interchangeably. Practitioners who require negligible measurement error in their assessment of movement velocity are advised to use linear position transducers over inertial sensors.},

Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 46, No. 4, pp. 776–786, 2014. Introduction: Proximal biceps femoris musculotendon strain injury has been well established as a common injury among athletes participating in sports that require sprinting near or at maximum speed; however, little is known about the mechanisms that make this muscle tissue more susceptible to injury at faster speeds. Purpose: This study aimed to quantify localized tissue strain during sprinting at a range of speeds. Methods: Biceps femoris long head ({BFlh}) musculotendon dimensions of 14 athletes were measured on magnetic resonance ({MR}) images and used to generate a finite-element computational model. The model was first validated through comparison with previous dynamic {MR} experiments. After validation, muscle activation and muscle–tendon unit length change were derived from forward dynamic simulations of sprinting at 70\%, 85\%, and 100\% maximum speed and used as input to the computational model simulations. Simulations ran from midswing to foot contact. Results: The model predictions of local muscle tissue strain magnitude compared favorably with in vivo tissue strain measurements determined from dynamic {MR} experiments of the {BFlh}. For simulations of sprinting, local fiber strain was nonuniform at all speeds, with the highest muscle tissue strain where injury is often observed (proximal myotendinous junction). At faster sprinting speeds, increases were observed in fiber strain nonuniformity and peak local fiber strain (0.56, 0.67, and 0.72 for sprinting at 70\%, 85\%, and 100\% maximum speed). A histogram of local fiber strains showed that more of the {BFlh} reached larger local fiber strains at faster speeds. Conclusions: At faster sprinting speeds, peak local fiber strain, fiber strain nonuniformity, and the amount of muscle undergoing larger strains are predicted to increase, likely contributing to the {BFlh} muscle’s higher injury susceptibility at faster speeds.},

	abstract = {Human skeletal muscles have different fiber types with distinct metabolic functions and physiological properties. The quantitative metabolic responses of muscle fibers to exercise provide essential information for understanding and modifying the regulatory mechanisms of skeletal muscle. Since in vivo data from skeletal muscle during exercise is limited, a computational, physiologically based model has been developed to quantify the dynamic metabolic responses of many key chemical species. This model distinguishes type I and {II} muscle fibers, which share the same blood supply. An underlying hypothesis is that the recruitment and metabolic activation of the two main types of muscle fibers differ depending on the pre-exercise state and exercise protocols. Here, activation measured by metabolic response (or enzymatic activation) in single fibers is considered linked but distinct from fiber recruitment characterized by the number (or mass) of each fiber type involved during a specific exercise. The model incorporates species transport processes between blood and muscle fibers and most of the important reactions/pathways in cytosol and mitochondria within each fiber type. Model simulations describe the dynamics of intracellular species concentrations and fluxes in muscle fibers during moderate intensity exercise according to various experimental protocols and conditions. This model is validated by comparing model simulations with experimental data in single muscle fibers and in whole muscle. Model simulations demonstrate that muscle-fiber recruitment and metabolic activation patterns in response to exercise produce significantly distinctive effects depending on the exercise conditions.},

Three electronic databases were systematically searched in August 2018 using the wildcard: powerlift*. A manual search was performed from the reference list of all retained articles. The search and selection strategy permitted to gather a total of 16 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Results show that practitioners should prioritize a low-bar squat and a wide grip bench press because they generally contribute to moving greater loads, bring more attention to preventing injuries, since a fair amount of powerlifters seem to train injured and prioritize a hypertrophy-power-strength model when prescribing 3 times a week daily undulating periodization on nonconsecutive days for squat and bench. Practitioners could also introduce respiratory muscle training, use daily 1 repetition maximum training combined with down sets on experienced athletes and use a rate of perceived exertion scale based on repetitions in reserve combined with an individual velocity profile when prescribing intensity. Before competition, powerlifters seem to taper in this order: the deadlift, the squat, and lastly the bench press. The Slingshot does help to move more weight because it helps to generate more inertia, but it also deactivates the triceps. Finally, the present work was limited by the present literature but could serve as a reference in the field of powerlifting. Further research should include more details about the circumstances under which they were conducted.},

J Strength Cond Res 35(12S): S26–S35, 2021—The purpose of this study was to characterize the tapering practices used by North American powerlifters. A total of 364 powerlifters completed a 41-item survey encompassing demographics, general training, general tapering, and specific tapering practices. Nonparametric statistics were used to assess sex (male and female), competition level (regional/provincial, national, and international), and competition lift (squat, bench press, and deadlift). The highest training volume most frequently took place 5–8 weeks before competition, whereas the highest training intensity was completed 2 weeks before competition. A step taper was primarily used over 7–10 days while decreasing the training volume by 41–50\% with varied intensity. The final heavy (.85\% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) back squat and deadlift sessions were completed 7–10 days before competition, whereas the final heavy bench press session was completed ,7 days before competition. Final heavy lifts were completed at 90.0–92.5\% 1RM but reduced to 75–80\% 1RM for back squat and bench press and 70–75\% for deadlift during the final training session of each lift. Set and repetition schemes during the taper varied between lifts with most frequent reports of 3 3 2, 3 3 3, and 3 3 1 for back squat, bench press, and deadlift, respectively. Training cessation durations before competition varied between deadlift (5.8 6 2.5 days), back squat (4.1 6 1.9 days), and bench press (3.9 6 1.8 days). Complete training cessation was implemented 2.8 6 1.1 days before competition and varied between sex and competition level. These findings provide novel insights into the tapering practices of North American powerlifters and can be used to inform powerlifting coaches and athlete’s tapering decisions.},

[Purpose] This study was performed to examine the relationship between physical performance and muscle properties during police cadet training. The study’s hypothesis was that improved physical performance brought about by training, would in turn cause a reduction in muscle flexibility. [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-nine police cadets were included in this study. Standard fitness tests and quantitative assessments of muscular biomechanical properties were conducted before, during and after the 20-week cadet training. [Results] General fitness had improved at the end of the police cadet training. There was no significant decrease in muscle flexibility as measured by the Sit-and-Reach test. However, muscle compliance of the non-dominant leg measured by the relaxation coefficient had decreased at the end of the police cadet training. [Conclusion] The increased sit-and-reach distance could be due in part to strengthening of the abdominal muscles. On the other hand, the biomechanical test, which was specific to muscle extensibility, showed a reduction in the relaxation coefficient of the non-dominant leg. Our data suggests that changes in muscle compliance as a result of lower extremity training should be considered. This data may be useful in the design of a training protocol that prevents the potential injuries caused by reduced muscle flexibility.},

	abstract = {Sarcomeres are the basic contractile units of muscle, and their lengths inﬂuence muscle force-generating capacity. Despite their importance, in vivo sarcomere lengths remain unknown for many human muscles. Second harmonic generation ({SHG}) microendoscopy is a minimally invasive technique for imaging sarcomeres in vivo and measuring their lengths. In this study, we used {SHG} microendoscopy to visualize sarcomeres of the human vastus lateralis, a large knee extensor muscle important for mobility, to examine how sarcomere lengths change with knee ﬂexion and thus affect the muscle's force-generating capacity. We acquired in vivo sarcomere images of several muscle ﬁbers of the resting vastus lateralis in six healthy individuals. Mean sarcomere lengths increased (p¼ 0.031) from 2.84 7 0.16 μm at 50° of knee ﬂexion to 3.17 70.13 μm at 110° of knee ﬂexion. The standard deviation of sarcomere lengths among different ﬁbers within a muscle was 0.21 70.09 μm. Our results suggest that the sarcomeres of the resting vastus lateralis at 50° of knee ﬂexion are near optimal length. At a knee ﬂexion angle of 110° the resting sarcomeres of vastus lateralis are longer than optimal length. These results show a smaller sarcomere length change and greater conservation of force-generating capacity with knee ﬂexion than estimated in previous studies.},

Physiol Rev 84: 209–238, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00019.2003.—Under normal circumstances, mammalian adult skeletal muscle is a stable tissue with very little turnover of nuclei. However, upon injury, skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to initiate a rapid and extensive repair process preventing the loss of muscle mass. Skeletal muscle repair is a highly synchronized process involving the activation of various cellular responses. The initial phase of muscle repair is characterized by necrosis of the damaged tissue and activation of an inflammatory response. This phase is rapidly followed by activation of myogenic cells to proliferate, differentiate, and fuse leading to new myofiber formation and reconstitution of a functional contractile apparatus. Activation of adult muscle satellite cells is a key element in this process. Muscle satellite cell activation resembles embryonic myogenesis in several ways including the de novo induction of the myogenic regulatory factors. Signaling factors released during the regenerating process have been identified, but their functions remain to be fully defined. In addition, recent evidence supports the possible contribution of adult stem cells in the muscle regeneration process. In particular, bone marrow-derived and muscle-derived stem cells contribute to new myofiber formation and to the satellite cell pool after injury.},

Bilateral vs. unilateral countermovement jumps: comparing the magnitude and direction of asymmetry in elite academy soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1660–1666, 2022—The aims of this study were to compare the magnitude and direction of asymmetry in comparable bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps ({CMJs}). Forty-five elite academy soccer players from under-23 (n 5 15), under-18 (n 5 16), and under-16 (n 5 14) age groups performed bilateral and unilateral {CMJs} as part of their routine preseason fitness testing. For the magnitude of asymmetry, no significant differences were evident for any metric between tests. However, the eccentric impulse asymmetry was significantly greater than mean force and concentric impulse in both bilateral and unilateral tests (p , 0.01). For the direction of asymmetry, Kappa coefficients showed poor levels of agreement between test measures for all metrics (mean force 5 20.15, concentric impulse 5 20.07, and eccentric impulse 5 20.13). The mean jump data were also presented relative to the body mass for each group. For the bilateral {CMJ}, significant differences were evident between groups but showed little consistency in the same group performing better or worse across metrics. For the unilateral {CMJ}, eccentric impulse was the only metric to show meaningful differences between groups, with the under-18 group performing significantly worse than under-23 and under-16 players. This study highlights that despite the magnitude of asymmetry being similar for each metric between comparable bilateral and unilateral {CMJs}, consistency in the direction of asymmetry was poor. In essence, if the right limb produced the larger force or impulse during a bilateral {CMJ}, it was rare for the same limb to perform superior during the unilateral task. Thus, practitioners should be aware that bilateral and unilateral {CMJs} present different limb dominance characteristics and should not use 1 test to represent the other when measuring between-limb asymmetries.},

	abstract = {Background: Eccentric exercise increases muscle fascicle lengths; however, the mechanisms behind this adaptation are still unknown. This study aimed to determine whether biceps femoris long head ({BFlh}) fascicle length increases in response to 3 weeks of eccentric exercise training are the result of an in-series addition of sarcomeres within the muscle ﬁbers.
Methods: Ten recreationally active participants (age = 27 § 3 years; mass = 70 § 14 kg; height = 174 § 9 cm; mean § {SD}) completed 3 weeks of Nordic hamstring exercise ({NHE}) training on a custom exercise device that was instrumented with load cells. We collected in vivo sarcomere and muscle fascicle images of the {BFlh} in 2 regions (central and distal) by using microendoscopy and 3 dimension ultrasonography. We then estimated sarcomere length, sarcomere number, and fascicle length before and after the training intervention.
Results: Eccentric knee ﬂexion strength increased after the training (15\%; p {\textless} 0.001; hp2 = 0.75). Further, we found a signiﬁcant increase in fascicle length (21\%; p {\textless} 0.001; hp2 = 0.81) and sarcomere length (17\%; p {\textless} 0.001; hp2 = 0.90) in the distal but not in the central portion of the muscle. The estimated number of sarcomeres in series did not change in either region.
Conclusion: Fascicle length adaptations appear to be heterogeneous in the {BFlh} in response to 3 weeks of {NHE} training. An increase in sarcomere length, rather than the addition of sarcomeres in series, appears to underlie increases in fascicle length in the distal region of the {BFlh}. The mechanism driving regional increases in fascicle and sarcomere length remains unknown, but we speculate that it may be driven by regional changes in the passive tension of muscle or connective tissue adaptations.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3338–3345, 2020—The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of an overload microcycle and taper on bench press velocity and to determine if the load-velocity relationship could accurately predict 1-repetition maximum (1RM). Twelve male powerlifters participated in resistance training structured into an introduction microcycle, overload microcycle ({PostOL}), and taper ({PostTP}). At the end of each microcycle, subjects completed a bench press for 1RM assessment consisting of warm-up sets at 40, 55, 70, and 85\% of a previously established 1RM. The mean concentric velocity ({MCV}) was recorded during each warm-up set. A predicted 1RM (p1RM) was calculated using an individualized load-velocity profile ({LVP}). The average {MCV} decreased after {PostOL} (0.66 6 0.07 m·s21) compared with baseline ({BL}) (p 5 0.003; 0.60 6 0.11 m·s21) but increased after {PostTP} (0.67 6 0.09 m·s21). One-repetition maximum increased from {PostOL} (146.7 6 19.8 kg) to {PostTP} (p 5 0.002; 156.1 6 21.0 kg), with no differences observed between other test sessions (p . 0.05). Bland-Altman analysis indicated that p1RM was consistently higher than measured 1RM (3.4–7.8 kg), and the limits of agreement were extremely wide. However, very large to near perfect correlations (r 5 0.89 to 0.96) were observed between p1RM and 1RM during {BL}, {PostOL}, and {PostTP}. The load-velocity relationship established from submaximal sets did not accurately predict 1RM, but {MCV} was affected by changes in weekly training loads. Velocity-based measurements seem to be more sensitive to changes in training loads than maximal strength.},

These unit balancing processes are: (1) the identification and rejection of model equations containing invalid unit arithmetic; (2) the insertion of scalar multipliers into the equations to convert existing units into fundamental units (in the {SI} or cgs systems); and (3) the assignment of units to variables and constants whose units are undeclared, based upon context. Used together, these three methods automate the otherwise tedious and error-prone process of manual unit balance checking thus producing more accurate and readable models. The implementation of these approaches, as in the {JSim} simulation modeling system, are general and could be incorporated into other modeling platforms.},

On the basis of publications and conference presentations, it is clear that the core concepts, conceptual frameworks, and the homeostasis concept inventory have been used by faculty in many ways to improve and assess student learning and align instruction and programs. A growing number of colleagues focus their teaching on physiology core concepts, and some core concepts have been used as explicit themes or organizing principles in physiology or anatomy and physiology textbooks. The core concepts published in 2011 were derived from inputs from a diverse group of physiology instructors and articulated what this group of instructors expressed a decade ago. On the basis of current feedback from the physiology teaching community as a consequence of the use of core concepts in teaching and learning, we have revisited these concepts and made revisions to address issues that have emerged. In this article, we offer revised definitions and explanations of the core concepts, propose an additional core concept (“physical properties of matter” which combines two previous concepts), and describe three broad categories for the revised core concepts. Finally, we catalog published resources for each of the core concepts that provide instructors tools to focus facilitation of student learning on goals (learning outcomes), activities and assessments to enable students to develop and apply their understanding of the core concepts of physiology.},

However, evidence for such force transmission effects is scarce under in vivo conditions. The purpose of this trial was to examine the impact of ankle motion on soft tissue displacement of the dorsal thigh. Eleven healthy active individuals (26.8 ± 4.3 years, six males), in prone position and with the knee extended, underwent passive calf stretches (ankle dorsal extension) imposed by an isokinetic dynamometer. High-resolution ultrasound was used to simultaneously capture the displacement of the semimembranosus muscle, which was quantiﬁed by means of cross-correlation analysis. Inactivity of the leg muscles was controlled using surface electromyography ({EMG}). One participant had to be excluded due to major {EMG} activity during the experiment. According to a one-sample t test testing the difference to the neutral zero position, ankle dorsal extension induced substantial caudal muscle displacements (5.76 ± 2.67 mm, p {\textless} 0.0001). Correlation analysis (Spearman), furthermore, revealed a strong association between maximal dorsal extension and semimembranosus motion (rho = 0.76, p = 0.02). In conclusion, the present trial provides initial in vivo evidence for a mechanical force transmission between serially connected skeletal muscles. This means that local alterations of the mechanical tissue properties may modify ﬂexibility in neighboring (superior or inferior) joints.},

We found age and sex to be the most complex factors in predicting powerlifting results. For women, in general, the younger the woman is the more they can squat; the older the woman is the less they can squat. For men and women, with the 1 exception for women’s squat, the peak age of lifting power is between the ages 24–49, at which point lifting power slowly declines. Women’s peak performance declines faster than men’s peak performance. Women seem to reach their peak sooner than men and decline sooner than men. We also analyzed match attendance. At matches with a large number of competitors, there is a 1:1.7 ratio of women to men, approximately a 2–3 ratio of women to men. Except for the lightest weight category of men, the ratio of weight to lift decreases the more they weigh. For example, a lighter person can generally lift a greater percentage of their weight than a heavier person. In addition, men in general can lift a heavier ratio of their weight when compared with women. The powerlifting stereotype of mostly heavy men lifting extremely large amounts of weights is simply wrong. There is a large amount of variation in age, weight, and sex.},

Res. 20(2):412–421. 2006.—It has been established that, in the sports of Olympic weightlifting ({OL}) and powerlifting ({PL}), the relationship between lifting performance and body mass is not linear. This relationship has been frequently studied in {OL}, but the literature on {PL} is less extensive. In this study, {PL} performance and body mass, for both men and women, was examined by using data from the International Powerlifting Federation World Championships during 1995–2004. Nonlinear regression was used to apply 7 models (including allometric, polynomial, and power models) to the data. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between {PL} performance and body mass can be best modeled by the equation y ϭ a Ϫ {bxϪc}, where y is the weight lifted (in kg) in the squat, bench press, or deadlift, x is the body mass of the lifter (in kg), and a, b, and c are constants. The constants a, b, and c are determined by the type of lift (squat, bench press, or deadlift) and the gender of the lifter and were obtained from the regression analysis. Inspection of the plots of raw residuals (actual performance minus predicted performance) vs. body mass revealed no body mass bias to this formula in contrast to research into other handicapping formulas. This study supports previous research that found a bias toward lifters in the intermediate weight categories in allometric ﬁts to {PL} data.},

Subjects reported for a total of 5 sessions which consisted of a 1RM testing session and 4 experimental trials. The 4 experimental conditions consisted of a traditional load ({TRAD}), traditional load with inter-repetition rest ({TRDC}), accentuated eccentric loading with inter-repetition rest ({AELC}), and Accentuated eccentric loading for the first repetition only ({AEL}1). Concentric load was 80\% of subjects’ 1RM for all conditions. An eccentric overload of 105\% of 1RM was applied using weight-releasing hooks during the {AEL} conditions. {TRDC} demonstrated superior concentric outputs for mean velocity and mean power compared with {TRAD}, {AELC}, and {AEL}1 (p , 0.001). In addition, {AEL}1 produced significantly greater effects for rate of force development compared with {TRDC} (p , 0.001). These findings suggest that inter-repetition rest had an influence on concentric performance, specifically mean power and mean velocity, and may be favorable when using higher loads and when sustained power outputs are desired. In addition, {AEL}1 may provide a unique eccentric stimulus that alters loading parameters compared with traditional loading conditions.},

Regarding {GTBM}, relative reliability was moderate to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC}]: 0.81–0.98), whereas absolute reliability was acceptable for abdomen, calf, chest, subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps brachii (coefficient of variation [{CV}]: 6.9–8.8\%) but high for axillary, biceps brachii, and thigh ({CV}: 12.0–17.4\%) in measuring fat thicknesses. Concerning {ITBM}, relative reliability was good to excellent ({ICC}: 0.93–0.99 and 0.90–0.98), whereas absolute reliability was acceptable ({CV}: 3.0–9.2\% and 3.5–5.9\%) in measuring fat and muscle thickness, respectively. These findings suggest that the, {GTBM} was only reliable in measuring fat thickness of abdomen, calf, chest, subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps brachii, whereas {ITBM} was reliable in measuring both fat and muscle thickness in all regions, but showed better reliability values in measuring muscle than fat thickness.},

	abstract = {For the past 60 years, muscle contraction had been thought to be governed exclusively by the contractile ﬁlaments, actin, and myosin. This thinking explained most observations for concentric and isometric, but not for eccentric muscle contractions. Just over a decade ago, we discovered that eccentric contractions were associated with a force that could not be assigned to actin and myosin, but was at least in part associated with the ﬁlamentous protein titin. Titin was found to bind calcium upon activation, thereby increasing its structural stability, and thus its stiffness and force. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the proximal part of titin binds to actin in an activation- and force-dependent manner, thereby shortening its free length, thus increasing its stiffness and force. Therefore, we propose that muscle contraction involves three ﬁlaments, actin, myosin and titin, and that titin regulates force by binding calcium and by shortening its spring length by binding to actin.},

	abstract = {Biomechanical models of whole muscles commonly used in simulations of musculoskeletal function and movement typically assume that the muscle generates force as a scaled-up muscle fiber. However, muscles are comprised of motor units that have different intrinsic properties and that can be activated at different times. This study tested whether a muscle model comprised of motor units that could be independently activated resulted in more accurate predictions of force than traditional Hill-type models. Forces predicted by the models were evaluated by direct comparison with the muscle forces measured in situ from the gastrocnemii in goats. The muscle was stimulated tetanically at a range of frequencies, muscle fiber strains were measured using sonomicrometry, and the activation patterns of the different types of motor unit were calculated from electromyographic recordings. Activation patterns were input into five different muscle models. Four models were traditional Hill-type models with different intrinsic speeds and fibertype properties. The fifth model incorporated differential groups of fast and slow motor units. For all goats, muscles and stimulation frequencies the differential model resulted in the best predictions of muscle force. The in situ muscle output was shown to depend on the recruitment of different motor units within the muscle.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, a multitude of concepts and models were developed to understand, assess and predict muscular mechanics in the context of physiological and pathological events. Most of these models are highly specialized and designed to selectively address fields in, e.g., medicine, sports science, forensics, product design or {CGI}; their data are often not transferable to other ranges of application. A single universal model, which covers the details of biochemical and neural processes, as well as the development of internal and external force and motion patterns and appearance could not be practical with regard to the diversity of the questions to be investigated and the task to find answers efficiently. With reasonable limitations though, a generalized approach is feasible. The objective of the work at hand was to develop a model for muscle simulation which covers the phenomenological aspects, and thus is universally applicable in domains where up until now specialized models were utilized. This includes investigations on active and passive motion, structural interaction of muscles within the body and with external elements, for example in crash scenarios, but also research topics like the verification of in vivo experiments and parameter identification. For this purpose, elements for the simulation of incompressible deformations were studied, adapted and implemented into the finite element code {SLang}. Various anisotropic, visco-elastic muscle models were developed or enhanced. The applicability was demonstrated on the base of several examples, and a general base for the implementation of further material models was developed and elaborated.},

	abstract = {The well-established sliding ﬁlament and cross-bridge theory explain the major biophysical mechanism responsible for a skeletal muscle’s active behavior on a cellular level. However, the biomechanical function of skeletal muscles on the tissue scale, which is caused by the complex interplay of muscle ﬁbers and extracellular connective tissue, is much less understood. Mathematical models provide one possibility to investigate physiological hypotheses. Continuum-mechanical models have hereby proven themselves to be very suitable to study the biomechanical behavior of whole muscles or entire limbs. Existing continuum-mechanical skeletal muscle models use either an active-stress or an active-strain approach to phenomenologically describe the mechanical behavior of active contractions. While any macroscopic constitutive model can be judged by it’s ability to accurately replicate experimental data, the evaluation of muscle-speciﬁc material descriptions is difﬁcult as suitable data is, unfortunately, currently not available. Thus, the discussions become more philosophical rather than following rigid methodological criteria. Within this work, we provide a extensive discussion on the underlying modeling assumptions of both the active-stress and the active-strain approach in the context of existing hypotheses of skeletal muscle physiology. We conclude that the active-stress approach resolves an idealized tissue transmitting active stresses through an independent pathway. In contrast, the active-strain approach reﬂects an idealized tissue employing an indirect, coupled pathway for active stress transmission. Finally the physiological hypothesis that skeletal muscles exhibit redundant pathways of intramuscular stress transmission represents the basis for considering a mixed-active-stress-active-strain constitutive framework.},

	abstract = {Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur in vivo. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Be´zier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.},
